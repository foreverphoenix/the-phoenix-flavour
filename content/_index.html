It all started with [The Phoenix Flavour](/tpf/introduction/), a manual modding guide that later became a Wabbajack setup. Since TPF, I have branched out and created the Wabbajack lists [Legends of the Frost](/lotf/introduction/) for Skyrim SE as well as [Welcome to Paradise](/wtp/introduction/) for Fallout 4. In addition to my own projects, this website features other Wabbajack lists that were based on TPF and LOTF. Find out more below.
