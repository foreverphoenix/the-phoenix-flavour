It all started with [The Phoenix Flavour](/tpf/introduction/), a manual modding guide that later became a Wabbajack setup. Since TPF, I have branched out and created the Wabbajack lists [Legends of the Frost](/skyrim-se/lotf/introduction/) and [Skyrim Modding Essentials](/skyrim-se/sme/introduction) for Skyrim SE as well as [Welcome to Paradise](/fo4/wtp/introduction/) for Fallout 4. In addition to my own projects, this website features other Wabbajack lists by friends of mine. Find out more below.
