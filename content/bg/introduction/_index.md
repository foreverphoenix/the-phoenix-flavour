  About my Skyrim Modding Beginner's Guide.
---

If you want to learn how to mod Skyrim, you have come to the right place. Welcome!

This is a *work-in-progress* beginner's guide by the author of **The Phoenix Flavour** modding guide (now discontinued) and more Wabbajack lists than they can possibly maintain. It was written as a spiritual successor to the manual TPF guide, but the intent is ultimately quite different.

While there are many fantastic modding guides and resources out there, I believe that the modding scene sorely lacks a unified, comprehensive resource to learn modding from scratch which could stem the tide of beginner’s mistakes flooding the modding subreddit every day. That is what I set out to provide.

## Expectations

**This is not a quick summary that will teach you some basics in a Saturday afternoon.** Such guides are already available in abundance. Instead, this guide was written for those who truly wish to learn how to mod, build a highly customised setup from scratch with all the troubleshooting and the hours in xEdit that this entails. If you are more interested in playing a modded setup than investing the time and energy to create your own, I highly recommend [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) - there is no shame in taking a shortcut and simply enjoying the fruits of other peoples’ labour.

I should add that I am very thorough, perhaps obsessively so, in managing my setups. I like doing things properly and in a clean fashion, because it helps me orient myself and keep a good overview of my setup. When tinkering with some 1,800 separate mod folders in TPF, this is absolutely essential.

It also means that I will be bringing a good amount of relatively minor steps and personal idiosyncrasies into this guide. As such, it is basically “How To Mod Skyrim: Phoenix’s Sometimes Unnecessarily Thorough Way” which is by no means the most efficient or objectively best way. Use your own brain, come up with your own little quirks and tricks, and take whatever you find helpful from my process, because my process is all I can offer you.

## Features

- **Currently supported:** Skyrim SE 1.6.640.0 and SKSE 2.2.2
- This guide uses **Mod Organizer 2** and the **Root Builder** plugin.

## Requirements

**This guide requires the Steam version of [Skyrim Special Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/).** Whether or not you have the Anniversary Edition DLC is irrelevant.
