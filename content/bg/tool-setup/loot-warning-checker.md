## About LOOT Warning Checker

The **LOOT Warning Checker** plugin integrates warnings from the [LOOT](/bg/tool-setup/loot/) masterlist into the Mod Organizer 2 warnings system.

### Installation

LOOT Warning Checker is available on the Nexus.

- Download the latest version of [LOOT Warning Checker](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/323?tab=files).
- Use the [shortcut](/Pictures/bg/mo2-plugins-folder-shortcut.png) to open the MO2 Plugins folder.
- **Close Mod Organizer 2.**
- Extract the **LOOT-Warning-Checker** folder from the downloaded archive into the **plugins** folder.
- Re-open Mod Organizer 2.

### Toggle Warnings

LOOT warnings can be helpful, but they are not infallible. For example, the tool may warn you about a missing patch when, in fact, you have replaced this patch with a custom plugin specific to your load order.

To prevent MO2 from constantly complaining about unnecessary warnings, I recommend keeping the LOOT warnings toggled <u>off</u> for the most part. You can re-enable them occasionally to see if anything relevant shows up.
