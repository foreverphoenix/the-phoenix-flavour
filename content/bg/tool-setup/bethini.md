## About BethINI

BethINI is a tool for modifying the vanilla INI files: Skyrim.ini, SkyrimPrefs.ini, and (optionally) SkyrimCustom.ini. Its optimised settings are based on extensive testing by DoubleYouC, a member of the STEP team.

The tool can be used for Oblivion and Fallout (NV/3/4) in addition to Skyrim (LE/SE).

### Installation

BethINI is available on the Nexus. Do not try to run it through Mod Organizer 2.

- Download [BethINI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4875) from its Nexus page.
- Create a folder called **BethINI** in your **Modding Tools** directory.
- Extract the downloaded archive into the new folder.

Always remember to <u>close</u> Mod Organizer 2 before running BethINI.

### Configuration

Please consult the [INI Files](/bg/additional-modules/ini-config/) page for more information and instructions.
