## Release 2.0

> TBD

- Better shadow INI settings (thanks SpringHeelJon!)
- Replaced Boston FPS Fix with Previs Pack to eliminate crashes and improve performance in even more areas

**Removal of CBBE and EVB:**

I ended up removing the body replacers in this update. There is simply nothing I really need CBBE for and EVB male bodies do not have dismemberment support.

**Removal of Workshop Re-arranged:**

Workshop Re-arranged is a pretty great workshop overhaul. Unfortunately, it's also extremely difficult to work with on account of its rebalancing edits which change many of the building requirements as well as junk scrap yields. I finally decided to ditch the mod and return to smaller, individual workshop additions.

**BOS Power Armor Paint Jobs:**

I realised that without the stat changes, there is no need to have separate Knight/Paladin/Sentinel paint jobs for the power armor as they are visually identical. The exception is the Left Arm piece which displays the rank insignia. I rectified this by adding a single "Brotherhood of Steel" paint job that can be applied to any piece of power armor, then limiting the rank-specific paint job to Left Arm pieces. Problem solved!

## Release 1.6.3

> 14/08/2021

This update finally brings back WTP after an extended downtime due to Nexit. I was extremely unhappy to remove the Stormy Nights main menu replacer and Full Dialogue Interface (for which the string patch was taken down), but there is nothing to be done. I apologise that it took me so long to bring WTP back, it remains more of a smaller side project for me and sadly I have not felt the Fallout 4 itch in quite some time. Nevertheless, the list has always been doing surprisingly well, much better than I had expected, so I will definitely continue to maintain it.

This is update is **not save-safe**. Please copy over the Game Folder Files into your root folder once again as the ENB binaries were updated.

#### Mod Changes

- Disabled frame limit in enblocal.ini (oversight from when I reinstalled ENBSeries in 1.6.2)
- Enabled VSYNC in High FPS Physics Fix (should always be on)
- Removed the main menu replacer as it was deleted from the Nexus (damn shame, it's been my favourite for years)
- Removed More Attackers - Get Off My Buildzone as a master from the CRP
- Removed More Attackers - Get Off My Buildzone (removed from the Nexus)
- Removed Full Dialogue Interface
- Removed String Patches for Full Dialogue Interface (removed from the Nexus)
- Removed F4 Creation Kit Fixes from Game Folder Files
- Updated ENBSeries binaries to 0.461
- Updated Workshop Framework to 2.0.16
- Updated Synthkind Redefined HD to 1.01
- Updated What's Your Name to 1.12.1
- Updated Vault 88 Essentials to 1.1
- Added Extended Dialogue Interface

## Release 1.6.2

> 27/06/2021

This is just a quick update to fix two minor issues and update a couple of mods. Since Wabbajack updated to 2.5.0.0, I had to recompile anyway.

Update your **Game Folder Files** to get the new ENBSeries binaries. The update is **save safe**.

#### Mod Changes

- Updated ENBSeries to 0.458
- Updated the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch to 2.1.3
- Updated Buffout to 1.23.1
- Updated Workshop Framework to 2.0.15a
- Updated FallUI - Inventory to 1.13.3
- Updated FallUI - HUD to 1.4
- Updated Console Commands Extender to 1.2.0
- Maybe fixed UI elements sometimes being misaligned
- Fixed a few minor issues in Home Plate (thanks C19i)

## Release 1.6.1

> 04/06/2021

As it turns out, I got sloppy last night. I'd already recompiled once when [Bullet Counted Reload System](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41178) updated and part of the update was support for [Tactical Reload](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/49444). I dropped in both, did a cursory check in xEdit, fixed some conflicts, and called it a day. Evidently I shouldn't have done that as something about the combination has caused frequent crashes in WTP 1.6 that was reported twice so far and I was able to reproduce it on my end. Dropping Tactical Reload fixed it so at least there was an easy solution. I haven't investigated further why exactly the crashes happen because I frankly don't care about the mod that much and don't have time today either.

This update is **save safe**. It's a crash fix. You'll be asked about missing plugins when loading your save, click Yes.

#### Mod Changes

- Removed Tactical Reload
- Replaced the TR version of BCR Lever Action Rifle with the regular one
- Removed Tactical Reload as a master from the CRP

## Release 1.6

> 03/06/2021

**Starting a new game is required.**

For this update I checked out the new **FallUI** suite of interface replacers and took the opportunity to review WTP's existing interface mods. I came to the decision to once again remove [Extended Dialogue Interface](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27216) and revert to [Full Dialogue Interface](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/1235) which I like far better. After careful consideration, I decided *against* including [FallUI - HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/51813) because even with my DEF_UI HUD preset, it would make item pickup prompts look [weird](https://i.imgur.com/Bd9w9VZ.jpg) with a huge gap between the item name and the button prompts. I also removed FallUI - Map because I didn't like it. However, FallUI - HUD and FallUI - Map are still going to be installed in case someone wants them (but are disabled by default).

I also removed **Widescreen** support. I can't test it, it's additional headache, I'd have to write extra instructions for changing the aspect ratio in the various FallUI MCMs. Sorry to everyone on ultrawide monitors, it's just not worth the effort to me.

When updating, please also move the Game Folder Files into your root folder and overwrite (ENB binaries updated).

**K-9 Harness**

Until now fadingsignal's K-9 Harness for Dogmeat could be crafted at the crafting station which was the original implementation. I have never been happy with this and in this update I finally did something about it. You can now find exactly *one* K-9 Harness in the world. The location happens to be a police station for obvious reasons - if you want to know where exactly you can find it, double-click the new K-9 Integration Patch in Mod Organizer 2 and check the **Notes** tab.

WTP 1.6 adds *optional* support for some "creations" (only the Modular Military Backpack so far). You can find details and instructions [here](/wtp/wtp-resources/creation-club).

*Turns out that Wabbajack auto-sets the resolution in the INI files.*

## Release 1.5.1

> 08/03/2021

I fixed some errors in `Power Armor Lore-Friendly Distribution.esp` by reverting the levelled lists for Atom Cats power armor to vanilla. That means they'll be wearing T-60 armor again (instead of T-51). I know I had Atom Cats T-51 armor *somewhere* but it seems to have gotten lost, resulting in these errors. I fully admit that this is a lazy solution but it works and that was always enough for Todd anyway.

While recompiling for WJ, I also updated the links to the website (see below).

## Global Site Update

> 08/03/2021

I finally did some spring cleaning. For the longest time it annoyed me that in my original folder structure I had categorised pages by games, for example the TPF part of the website was called "Skyrim SE" in the top menu. But what if I want to start another SE project? And you don't want to know the chaos in my pictures folder either.

The reason I hesitated for so long to change the folder names is because it breaks every, single, link. And while fixing the internal links and file paths was merely a minor annoyance, fixing all external links is more difficult - especially considering that other people may link to TPF as well and those links are now broken. Of course I also need to recompile both TPF and WTP for Wabbajack to update the links that open automatically upon installing a Wabbajack list.

Well, I finally updated now and I'm very happy with the changes. It likely will take some time for all external links to get fix plus I suspect I may have missing some internal links and file paths.

#### Changes

- Removed the Bioware section (see below).
- Renamed "Skyrim SE" to "The Phoenix Flavour" (link changed from skyrim-se to tpf).
- Renamed "Fallout 4" to "Welcome to Paradise" (link changed from fallout to wtp).
- Updated all internal links and file paths - hopefully.
- Cleaned up my pictures folder to remove any pictures that are no longer in the guide.
- Updated the home page, it has two buttons now and a combination of the TPF and WTP pics.

#### Bioware

The current state of things is that I have published a guide for ME1 with a draft for an ME2 version waiting for revision. But here's the thing: Modding Bioware games is quite different from modding Bethesda games. I've only really dipped my toes in it and wouldn't call myself an expert by any stretch of the imagination. Something I often criticise about various smaller Skyrim modding "guides" is that their authors barely know what they're doing. It occured to me that my Mass Effect "guides" are in essence the same thing ~~with better formatting~~.

To keep a longer story short, I have developed a strong sense of imposter syndrome over those excursions into Bioware land that is causing me a fair amount of stress. Something I've learned over the past couple years is that if you have too many things putting pressure on you at once, cut out everything that's non-essential. Well, this time the scissors are for the Bioware section of the TPF website.

#### Simple Sorting Overhaul

As we have now switched to FallUI from DEF_INV, I updated my INNRs (naming rules) to have the same format as Ruddy's sorting patcher that FallUI was intended for. That means mods for armors and weapons will be displayed in smaller font below the item name.

I did take a look at the [Complex Sorter](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48826) for FallUI which would be very convenient for me but ultimately I prefer my own icons and INNRs. Plus they already cover my power armor changes and include my preferred power armor naming scheme.

#### Website Changes

I went over all pages and fixed what I thought needed fixing. Screenshots were updated, sentences were rephrased, and instructions were clarified.

- **Finalisation:** Added instructions for the optional LUTs.
