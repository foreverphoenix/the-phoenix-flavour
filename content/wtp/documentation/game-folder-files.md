  Files that need to be moved into the root folder manually.

While regular mods for Bethesda games are installed into the **data** folder, there are some additional tools that belong into the **root** folder. These are not automatically moved by Wabbajack. Instructions for them are included in the **Installation** setup, this page merely serves as an overview over the files in question and their purpose.

> WTP does not use the Stock Game Folder system and likely never will.
