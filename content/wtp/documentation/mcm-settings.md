## Configurable Hotkeys

- Use Stimpak: **CTRL + G**
- Toggle Radio: **CTRL + B**

> Please note that any hotkeys bound through this mod are not blacklisted in menus and will fire when renaming a weapon in the workbench for instance. Thus, it is necessary to use keys that are not letters or combinations of multiple keys. Also be aware that Toggle Workshop and Show Wait Menu are not bound because hotkeys for them are covered by other mods.

## FallUI Inventory

- Coloring was set to **Green light** for all menus

## Faster Workshop

This mod is only included for its hotkey feature as Buffout already improves the workshop loading speed.

- Start Workshop Mode: **Y**

## HoloTime

HoloTime is *disabled* by default and needs to be turned on first.

- Downscaled to size .7 and relocated to the top right where it won't clash with notifications boxes
- Toggle HoloTime Display to **H** (HUD needs to be enabled)

## Workshop Framework

As the hint in the MCM suggests, the vanilla Shelter mechanic (where settlers' happiness is reduced if the game cannot detect a roof over their bed) is buggy. I prefer disabling it altogether:

- Shelter Mechanic: **OFF**

Just build your settlers' beds somewhere below a roof to protect your immersion and ignore this buggy mechanic.

![Workshop Framework MCM 1](/Pictures/wtp/documentation/workshop-framework-mcm-1.jpg)

Workshop Framework has a neat feature that automatically closes doors after a few seconds. Settlers are unfortunately able to open them, but will never close them again so you usually have all doors in your settlement standing wide open. Having them close automatically finally fixes that.

- Door Management: **ON**
- Auto-Close Delay: **10** (seconds)

![Workshop Framework MCM 2](/Pictures/wtp/documentation/workshop-framework-mcm-2.jpg)

Finally, I highly recommend disabling the Manage Workbench prompt:

- Manage Workbench **OFF**

The Manage menu accessible at workbenches is only for scrapping stuff placed by the player and the WF layouts feature. Since TPF Fallout 4 doesn't currently include additional layouts, I would rather people disabled this entirely to prevent confusion. If you are interested in WF layouts, re-enable the Manage Workbench option and watch kinggath's tutorials on [importing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3MGiari9xc&feature=emb_logo) and [exporting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OVzgFzjnRw&feature=emb_logo) them. Obviously, downloading and installing layouts counts as adding mods and voids your right to get support for WTP.
