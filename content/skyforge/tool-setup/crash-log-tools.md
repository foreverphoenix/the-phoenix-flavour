## About Crash Log Tools

**Crash Log Tools** is a plugin for Mod Organizer 2 which adds the ability to view crash logs generated by [Crash Logger](/skyforge/mod-recommendations/utilities-frameworks/#crash-logger) directly through the MO2 UI. This is far more convenient than navigating manually to where the logs are saved under `\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE\`.

In addition, the plugin will attempt to label known addresses in crash logs which may help with tracking down the cause of a crash.

### Installation

Crash Log Tools is available on the Nexus.

- Download the latest version of [Crash Log Tools](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66743?tab=files).
- Use the [shortcut](/Pictures/skyforge/mo2-plugins-folder-shortcut.png) to open the MO2 Plugins folder.
- **Close Mod Organizer 2.**
- Extract the downloaded archive into the **plugins** folder.
- Re-open Mod Organizer 2.

You should now be able to access **Crash Log Tools** through the Toolbar:
