## General Remarks

LOD Resources are used to improve LODs generated with [SSELODGen](/skyforge/tool-setup/sselodgen/) or [DynDOLOD](/skyforge/tool-setup/dyndolod/). You always need the DynDOLOD Resources, Scripts, and DLL as well as the SSE-Terrain-Tamriel-Extend, the installation instructions for which are covered in the linked modules for the respective tools.

### Mod Order

- xLODGen Resource - SSE Terrain Tamriel
- DynDOLOD Resources
- DynDOLOD - Scripts and DLL
  - *NG or regular.*
- Far Object LOD Improvement Project

##### [Far Object LOD Improvement Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79197)

{{< alert color="info" >}}**Recommended.** Very useful in any setup (that is using DynDOLOD 3).{{< /alert >}}

Far Object LOD Improvement Project (FOLIP) adds resources for DynDOLOD 3 generation. It is mainly used to add **roads** to the map for *A Clear Map of Skyrim and Other Worlds* but also adds LODs for the glowing mushrooms in Blackreach and the Tundra Homestead creation.

**Requirement(s):** [LOD Generation](/skyforge/modding-resources/lod-occlusion/) (effect will not be visible until LODs were rebuilt)
