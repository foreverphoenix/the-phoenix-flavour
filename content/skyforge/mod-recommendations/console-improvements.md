##### [More Informative Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/197667)

{{< alert color="success" >}}**Essential.** Everyone should install this mod.{{< /alert >}}

More Informative Console turns the console from a decently useful into an invaluable dev tool. Its most immediate usecase is checking the Form ID of a given object (it helpfully displays both Base and Ref ID) or to see which mesh the object is using, but it can display a variety of other information, including an NPC's factions, inventory, etc.

**Requirements:** Skyrim Script Extender, Address Library for SKSE
