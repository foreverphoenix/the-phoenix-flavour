## About the Creation Club

Alongside the engine upgrade, there was another major feature introduced with Skyrim Special Edition: The **Creation Club**. This ingame cash shop offers "creations", mini DLC, made by Bethesda developers and freelancers, many of them well-known members of the modding community. At the time of the initial roll-out, the price tags and lack of interesting content evoked memories of [horse armor](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/horse-armor).
 
The negative reaction from the modding community toward the Creation Club was compounded by the fact that while we largely wanted to ignore the Creation Club, we were unable to do so: <mark>Every successive Skyrim update, including ones released solely for the Creation Club, requires crucial mods like SKSE and SKSE plugins to be update.</mark> This stirred some resentment in the community, though solutions were found in time.*

While the initial line-up was somewhat underwhelming compared to the wealth of mods available on PC, the Creation Club was expanded over the years. Between creations, the quality varies wildly and the lack of voice acting is often glaring. Nevertheless, the asset quality and level design of some creations is excellent.

Since the release of the Anniversary Edition DLC (which bundled all creations together with a more reasonable $20 price tag) the uptake in the modding community has been much higher. Integration mods and patch support are easily found, and the controversy has mostly died down. **Separate creations or the AE DLC are increasingly a requirement for mods and Wabbajack lists.**

{{< alert color="info" >}}It should be noted that the modding community was never the intended target group for the Creation Club. It was aimed at players who only ever played the vanilla game and who were therefore more interested in hassle-free content additions. The Creation Club was less controversial in these demographies. Meanwhile, for the longest time, nothing that was published as a creation did not already exist as a mod (and often in better quality, too).{{< /alert >}}
