## MO2 Plugins

One of the perks of [Mod Organizer 2](/skyforge/tool-setup/mo2/) is that the tool *extensible* with third-party plugins. A number of core features are implemented via pre-installed plugins, including BSA management and texture preview.

All plugins are installed into `\Mod Organizer 2\plugins\`.

If they have settings, you can configure them in the MO2 [Settings](/Pictures/skyforge/tool-setup/mo2/mo2-open-settings.png) (Plugins tab).
