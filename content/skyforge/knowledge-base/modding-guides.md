## About Modding Guides

{{< alert color="warning" >}}In this article I am specifically referring to "traditional" modding guides which offer a instructions for re-creating a pre-made setup consisting of a specific list of mods.{{< /alert >}}

There are many guides to modding Skyrim and not all of them are valuable resources. Especially for newcomers to the hobby, it is unfortunately difficult to recognise quality, and scammers prey upon the inexperienced by selling (often literally) promises that are impossible to keep.

**Any guide that does not include file modification and custom patches can be disregarded.** These steps are essential to building a stable, high quality setup. The same is true if specific installation as well as mod and load order instructions are missing.

### Recommended Guides

Since the advent of [Wabbajack](/skyforge/knowledge-base/wabbajack/), the popularity of traditional modding guides has receded. However, there are still multiple guides of high quality available which you can follow.

- [Lexy's Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://lexyslotd.com/)
- [STEP Guide for Skyrim SE](https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/SkyrimSE:2.2.0)
- [The Northern Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23894)
- [A Dragonborn's Fate](https://dragonbornsfate.moddinglinked.com/)

My own manual guide, [The Phoenix Flavour](/tpf/introduction/) is <u>discontinued and outdated</u>.
