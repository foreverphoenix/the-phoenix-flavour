If there has been a recent Skyrim SE update, this guide (and possibly the rest of the modding community) may not have caught up yet in which case <u>downgrading to the last supported version of Skyrim is recommended</u>. The process is made painless by halgari’s automatic downgrade patcher.

- Determine which version of **Skyrim SE** you are on and which version you require ([instructions](/skyforge/modding-resources/skyrim-script-extender/#version-check)).
- Download the corresponding full patcher from [the mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618?tab=files) (click **Manual Download**).
  - You will probably find the required version under **Old Files** (use CTRL+F to search).
- Move the downloaded executable to your installation under `\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\`.
- Run the executable and wait for it to finish (should take only a few seconds).

{{< alert color="info" >}}Alternatively, you can use halgari’s [Unofficial Skyrim Downloader](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61756). I will add instructions for this at a later date.{{< /alert >}}

To prevent Skyrim from automatically updating, consider [Update Proofing](/skyforge/modding-resources/update-proofing) the game.
