Follow these steps to find out which version of Skyrim you currently have installed:

- Navigate to `\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\`.
- Right-click the **SkyrimSE.exe** inside and select **Properties**.
- Switch to the **Details** tab and check under **Product version**.

{{< alert color="success" >}}**Currently recommended version:** Skyrim SE 1.6.640 (Steam).*{{< /alert >}}

<font size="2">\**The vast majority of mods are now available on 1.6.640 and there is very little reason to stay on 1.5.97 at this point. For 1.6.1170 many mods still need updates.*</font>

{{< alert color="warning" >}}If your version of Skyrim SE does not correspond to the version specified above, I recommend you [downgrade](/skyforge/modding-resources/downgrade-skyrim/) to that version.{{< /alert >}}
