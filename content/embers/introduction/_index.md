  About Embers - A Beginner's Guide.

## Preamble

**Embers** is the Beginner's Guide to modding Skyrim SE that I always wanted to write.

When I first got into modding myself sometime back in 2014, I had the same experience as most modding novices: Watching various YouTube tutorial, reading Nexus forum threads, scouring reddit posts and comments, trying to gather all the information I could find. Some of those sources contradicted each other, some were outdated, some were plain wrong. With no previous experience, I had no way to know which resources to trust.

There have been many guides to modding Skyrim over the years, including beginner's guides written or recorded to teach basic modding skills to newcomers. To my knowledge, however, there has never been a comprehensive resource, a fully-featured guide to take you through the basics and beyond. A guide that does not repeat common modding myths, that does not rely exclusively on LOOT, or completely disregard asset management. A guide that understands that the key to assembling a stable, coherent mod setup is learning how to utilise various modding tools to the best of their potential as well as how mods work on a fundamental level.

This is what **Embers** is intended to be.

### About Embers

**Embers is:**

- ...a beginner's guide to modding Skyrim SE. No previous modding experience is required.
- ...interactive. Each lesson will guide you through a specific step in modding the game.
- ...written to clear up common misconceptions and equip its users with a solid understanding of mods and various tools. 

**Embers is not:**

- ...a mod list or mod guide in the commonly understood sense of the word. It is a resource for building your own setup.
- ...a quick rundown of the basics. It expects you to be committed to learning how to mod Skyrim.

## Shortcuts

If you have never modded before, following **Embers** will *not* help you build a stable 200+ mod setup in time for the weekend. Choosing and installing mods takes time. Editing, tweaking, patching takes *a lot* of time. The goal is to have a near flawless experience: a stable, balanced, consistent game. The more mods you wish to include, the longer it will take.

Learning how to mod Skyrim is not for everyone - not everyone has the free time to spare, or the mental energy and motivation. Maybe you just want to play Skyrim with mods. Fortunately, there are shortcuts:

[Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) is an automated mod list installer capable of reproducing another person's setup on your machine, fully patched and ready to go all without actually redistributing any mod files. This will not allow you any customisation but there are many Wabbajack lists to choose from and you are likely to find one that piques your interest. A Wabbajack mod list can be installed within a few hours, depending on your internet connection.


[The Phoenix Flavour](/tpf/) and [Lexy's LOTD](https://lexyslotd.com/) are modding guides. They document every step required for the full installation of large, pre-made setups, complete with custom patches. Unlike Wabbajack lists, they must still be followed manually which can take up to a week, depending on how much time you can invest. Guides also teach you a good deal of modding basics.

[STEP](https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/SkyrimSE:2.0.0) and [Lexy's LOTD](https://lexyslotd.com/) are modding guides. They document every step required for the full installation of large, pre-made setups, complete with custom patches. Unlike Wabbajack lists, they must still be followed manually which can take up to a week, depending on how much time you can invest. Guides also teach you a good deal of modding basics.

**If you really just want to play modded without learning much about modding, Embers is *not* for you. You should choose one of the above options instead.**

## Guide Structure

Many of the basics for Skyrim modding are simply knowledge of mods and certain tools. While I could summarise the most important steps and concepts one at a time, I believe it is easier to familiarise yourself with them if you are actually following along to instructions with examples that you can observe on your end. This should be preferable over a large info dump and a more efficient way to learn.
