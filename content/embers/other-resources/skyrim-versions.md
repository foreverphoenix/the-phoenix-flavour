# Skyrim Versions

Since it is virtually impossible to keep track of the various versions of Skyrim that were released over the years, here is a breakdown.

## Skyrim (SLE)

It all began on 11/11/11 with the original release of Skyrim. The existing Bethesda modding scene dived in head-first and got to work. As we know, the initial release was a huge success and followed up with three DLC in quick succession: Dawnguard (Summer 2012), Hearthfire (Autumn 2012), and Dragonborn (Winter 2013).

==Mods created for the original Skyrim usually need to be ported before they work properly in subsequent versions.==

Interesting to note: The original Skyrim release is the only version which has a Steam workshop page.

In Summer 2013, the base game and all three DLC were packaged together and sold as **Skyrim Legendary Edition** which is why the 2011 release of Skyrim is generally referred to as **SLE**.

### Console Releases

Skyrim and Skyrim Legendary Edition released for XBOX 360 and Playstation 3. The console versions were not moddable.

## Skyrim Special Edition (SSE)

**Skyrim Special Edition (SSE)** was a remaster released in autumn 2016, packaged with all three DLC. It features an engine overhaul ported over from Fallout 4 which notably brought it from 32bit to 64bit, eliminating memory issues and improving stability.

The visual changes were moderate (and occasionally controversial); however, for modding, the engine upgrade was a big deal. Just by itself, SSE is rock solid (unlike SLE), and it is much harder to destabilise with mods.

The one downside of SSE is that mods made for SLE had to ported and, in some cases, rebuilt from the ground up for SSE.

### SSE versus SLE

After the release of SSE, adoption was slow in the modding scene and it took years before most people had moved over. Because many mods that were considered essential were only ported or replaced much later, modders with existing setups opted to stay on SLE.

This changed. Nowadays, there is only a small number of (mostly niche) mods that have no equivalent in Skyrim Special Edition, and the overwhelming majority of mod authors has moved on. New releases are not always backported. 

There are two reasons to play SLE in 2022: Either you have hardware that is unable to run unmodded SSE, or you have an established setup from before 2016 and do not want to start over. If neither is the case, pick SSE. It offers a more stable baseline and gets all the latest mod releases.

### Console Releases

Skyrim Special Edition was also released for the (then) next-gen consoles, XBOX One and PlayStation 4. For the first time, the console versions were also moddable.

However, it is important to note that ==console modding is not comparable to PC modding==: The lack of SKSE support means available mods are rudimentary in nature and require inelegant workarounds. It is not possible to use any additional modding tools, or manage or modify assets manually. Finally, there is a hard limit on space.

Finally, a Nintendo Switch port of Skyrim SE was released which can be modded (if the Switch is jailbroken which, of course, voids the warranty).

### Creation Club

The [Creation Club](<Creation Club>) was added with Skyrim Special Edition.

## Skyrim VR

In 2017 Skyrim Special Edition was ported to PC and Playstation VR. As far as modding is concerned, it is similar to SSE, but requires a separate version of the Script Extender. Some SKSE plugins do not work with VR while other mods may need extra steps. There are also mods exclusive to VR.

## Anniversary Edition DLC

For its 10th anniversary, Skyrim was, once again, re-released under a new name as **Skyrim Anniversary Edition**. The new version is typically abbreviated as **SAE** which is a potential source of confusion because it suggests SAE is a separate game in the same way that SLE and SSE are. This is not the case. ==The Anniversary Edition is just a DLC bundling together all [Creation Club](<Creation Club>) releases.== What is sold as "Skyrim Anniversary Edition" is Skyrim Special Edition with the Anniversary Edition DLC.

Because there were no technical change or upgrades shipped alongside the AE DLC release, there is no need to port mods from previous versions and creations added with the AE DLC can easily be used on pre-AE versions of Skyrim SE.

> The Anniversary Edition DLC is not available for Skyrim VR.

### Console Versions

The **Anniversary Edition** bundle (SSE + AE DLC) was also ported to the latest consoles, XBOX Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch.

## Patches

Because of the frequent updates to Skyrim SE (including the AE release), the modding community lags behind with every update and some mods are inevitably "lost". Playing the latest version, especially if Skyrim recently updated, can lock you out of using many essential mods so it is important to pay attention to the current patch version.

- ==**1.5.97**== was the last pre-AE version of Skyrim SE. A good number of people are still playing this version as most version-dependent mods are compatible with it and the new AE creations can be imported as well. Nevertheless, new mod releases and updates are often no longer backported to 1.5.97.
- ==**1.6.317**== was the SSE patch that accompanied the Anniversary Edition DLC release (and was quickly succeeded by 1.6.318). This, and all subsequent patches, are available for all Skyrim SE owners, regardless of whether you own the AE DLC.
- ==**1.6.353**== is the current best post-AE patch because most mods have been ported for it.
- ==**1.6.640**== is the latest version of Skyrim SE. Many mods still lack ports.

## PC Versions

Patches, ports, oh my --- wait, there is *another* category?

Yes. You see, Skyrim SE/AE has been released on multiple storefronts for PC and those versions differ.

- All versions of Skyrim - SLE, SSE, SVR, and SAE - are available on **Steam**. SKSE versions exist for all releases.
- The **Microsoft Store** version of SSE cannot be modded at all.
- The new **GOG** release of Skyrim SE/AE can be modded. A new version of SKSE was created to support it and mods are being updated for it as well.
- It is currently unclear whether the new **Epic Games** store version can be modded.

Currently, the Steam version is your best bet; however, in the (near) future the GOG version may become superior when there is better mod support. For one, you have greatly improved version control and are able to specifically select the SSE patch you want. It is also devoid of the ingame Creation Club (with the creations being available only in the AE bundle).

### Steam Deck

Skyrim is moddable on the Steam deck - you can even install Wabbajack lists. The process is apparently somewhat janky and requires performance optimisations, but it works.
