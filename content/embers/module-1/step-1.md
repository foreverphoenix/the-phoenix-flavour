## Skyrim

**Embers** is a guide for and requires a Steam copy of [Skyrim Special Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/). Whether you own the Anniversary Edition DLC is irrelevant.

There are a number of  notable differences between the various versions of Skyrim that have been released since 2011 which are important to be aware of when modding the game. The most substantial change came in 2016 when the remastered **Skyrim Special Edition** (SSE) was released, featuring a 64bit engine upgrade with far-reaching consequences for the modding community. Most mods created for **Classic Skyrim** (the 2011 version with the 32bit engine) need to be ported before they can be used safely in SSE.

Arguably the most important tool for modding is the **Skyrim Script Extender** (SKSE) which needed a full rewrite for Skyrim SE. Without SKSE, many of the best mods out there will straight up not work. Different versions of SKSE are now available for Classic Skyrim, Skyrim SE, Skyrim VR, and Skyrim AE.

> SKSE is not compatible with the PC Xbox Game Pass version of Skyrim SE. A Steam copy is required for Embers.

Although the modding scene for Skyrim SE had a slow start, it has grown massively since 2016. Nowadays, many mods are developed exclusively for SSE and the most exciting new releases are usually exclusive to SSE as well. Due to this and the stability improvements that the engine upgrade provided, SSE is the superior option for modding today.

**Skyrim Anniversary Edition** (SAE) was released in 2021 as an update for Skyrim SE. The Anniversary Edition DLC has to be purchased separately, but the patch that accompanied it was applied to all SSE installations. Mods function the same in SAE as in SSE, although SKSE needed to be partially rewritten so that there is now a version of SKSE for AE in addition to the one for SSE.

While currently there are no advantages in using Skyrim SE `1.6.x` (post-AE versions) over Skyrim SE `1.5.97.0` (pre-AE version), mods are usually developed for the latest version available. The community has already (slowly) moved on to 1.6.x which is why **Embers** was written for the post-AE versions as well.

## Modding Folder

Before we start messing with the game files, please go ahead and create a new folder in a convenient location. This folder will hold certain file backups as well as all your downloaded mod archives so it may get rather big. Since the archives are not needed for actual gameplay (they will be unpacked and installed), I recommend storing them on a hard drive where space is not an issue. Any HDD will do.

Throughout the guide I will be referring to this folder as **Your Modding Folder**.

- Create a top level folder, e.g. `F:\Skyrim SE Modding\`.
- Within that new folder create several more as shown below:

## Spring Cleaning

Now comes the boring part: We need to make sure your Skyrim SE installation is absolutely pristine and that no traces of previous modding setups remain on your PC. Additionally, we will ensure the game files are located in a suitable location.

**Uninstall Skyrim SE through Steam.** (If you currently have the game installed.)

### Mod Files

Navigate to where the game was installed which is probably `C:\Program Files x86\Steam\steamapps\common\`. If there is still a **Skyrim Special Edition** folder in this location after uninstalling the game through Steam, it means you had non-vanilla (meaning mod-added) files in your game folder. These are not removed when uninstalling the game and may get in the way of the **Embers** setup.

Delete the **Skyrim Special Edition** folder if it still exists after uninstalling the game.

### Documents Folder

Next we will take a look at the **Documents** folder.

> If you have never run Skyrim SE before, this folder will not exist for you and you can skip ahead to the next step, **Game Language**.

- Navigate to `C:\Users\Your User Name\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\`

This directory may contain multiple files and folders: The **Skyrim.ini** and **SkyrimPrefs.ini** are the game's primary configuration files, they will become very relevant later on. There may also be a **saves** folder which, you guessed it, contains your save games. If you have any vanilla saves that you would like to hold on to, move the **saves** folder to `\Your Modding Folder\Backups\` from where you can restore it anytime. Lastly, the Documents folder may also include mod-generated files such as logs.

- Make sure you have backed up any saves you want to keep.
- Delete the entire **Skyrim Special Edition** folder.

The folder and INI files will be freshly regenerated very soon.

That's it. Skyrim SE is now completely removed from your system.

## Game Language

Skyrim supports a bunch of different languages natively, but mods do not. Since many mods also do not require translations in the first place and some of the ones that do have third-party translations available, it is theoretically possible to play modded in Skyrim in a language other than English. However, this will complicate your setup immensely. Translations, where available, may be outdated or incomplete. They may not cover voice acting. They may require editing of dozens of texture templates in Photoshop. They may not exist for some of your mods at all.

Ultimately, translating any records (and certain textures!) untouched by existing patches plus fixing conflicts between translations and mods will add a hefty amount of work on top of everything else. I do not recommend it, especially not for a beginner.

If your game is currently set to a language other than English, you can change this quickly in Steam. The English files will be downloaded immediately if you have the game currently installed, or the next time you install the game. Please note that an English language copy of Skyrim SE is mandatory for **Embers**.

- Right-click **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition** in your Steam games library.
- Select **Properties** and switch to the **Language** tab.
- Ensure that the language is set to **English**.

## Reinstalling Skyrim

Under normal circumstances, Skyrim should be installed in a specific location (an SSD in a Steam Library outside any UAC protected folders). However, **Embers** will make use of the *Stock Game folder system* which duplicates the vanilla files to create a fully self-contained modded setup. This setup can co-exist with the vanilla game which is untouched as well as any number of modded setups for the same game. The method is primarily used for Wabbajack lists, but it is incredibly useful for regular setups as well.

Find the game in your library (in the Steam app) and click the big blue **INSTALL** button. Where you install the game is irrelevant.

**Proceed when the download is complete.**

## First Test Run

At this point, we should see if Skyrim launches properly. Running the game once serves multiple purposes:

- The `\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\` folder including its INI files will be regenerated.
- The registry keys will be set up which is required for modding tools to recognise your installation.
- Certain issues with your vanilla game can be detected now.

> Always remember to launch Skyrim once after updating or re-installing it, or after verifying game files.

In Steam, click the big green **PLAY** button to open the launcher.

- A message box will pop up, informing you that Skyrim SE will now be configured based on your hardware.
- Click **OK** twice to confirm (we will modify the INI files later on).
- Click the **PLAY** option in the launcher and wait until you are in the Skyrim main menu.
- **AE OWNERS:** Skyrim will prompt you with a message box, then proceed to download the creations. Wait for it to finish.
- Quit the game from the main menu. If you got this far, everything appears to be running smoothly.

> If Skyrim is unable to detect your hardware, itâ€™s likely because you have a newer graphics card. You can safely ignore this as we will regenerate INIs from scratch later on.
