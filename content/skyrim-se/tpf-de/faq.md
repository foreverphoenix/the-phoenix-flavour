## Installation

> Does my installation folder need to be the same one that I used for TPF if I want to have both TPF and the fork?

It is possible to have both TPF and my fork's WJ versions on your computer by making different installation folders for them. Your downloads folder can and should be the same to make the installation process faster and not to make you download TPF's mods once again.

---

> Some mods appear as not downloaded in Mod Organizer 2. Is that intended?

Well, it isn't, but it is just purely visual bug of MO2, which happens when you use Wabbajack to install the list. Nevermind it.

---

> Are all releases of the list available to be downloaded?

Yes, you will be able to find them on [TPF DE's Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51973).

## Content

> Will any of the survival mods or Legacy of the Dragonborn ever be added to TPF DE?

No. There are already many modpacks and guides, which are built around LotD and/or survival mechanic in mind, and that is enough. In my opinion, LotD is too intrusive and makes you work around it for too much, while not actually offering as much, and I just don't like survival mode overall as it doesn't make gameplay more enjoyable. It does exactly the opposite - makes the game more annoying to play. Each game should have its boundaries of immersiveness. For me it is a fantasy, where I want to enjoy what I can't exactly experience at all or as much in my daily life, so I don't exactly need to think about how character eats, drinks, washes themselves and does other everyday things.

> What about that, that and... that?

Feel free to check my [feedback reports](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u030JaTyAtv5IT2uMx-0oHidyLpXGPuf?usp=sharing) if you want to know which mods possibly won't make it into the list. I usually make it pretty clear.

## Gameplay

> Is overall difficulty and combat changed by the list?

Combat is affected primarily by Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul, which adds complexity to the vanilla hack-and-slash system. It adds emphasis on stamina management and movement. Also it adjusts the difficulty modifiers, slightly increasing incoming damage. With those changes, combat will feel noticeably more difficult than vanilla to the point where you may be one-shot by certain enemy types.

Overall it is harder considering the fact that vanilla was too easy, but it definitely isn't something you can't handle, because we aren't playing Dark Souls, but at the same time you probably wouldn't like to press random buttons to win. By the way I have added some mechanics to places, where TPF has made no changes and which aren't intrusive. For example, adding a 15% chance of giving useful perks for NPCs to make them more interesting to fight, getting rid of the lock-picking mini game and actually using our lock-picking skill to succeed in picking locks etc.

Refer to [the gameplay guide](../gameplay-guide) if you want to learn more about the list.

> How can I improve modpack's performance on my computer?

1. Downscale your resolution if you are playing on 1440p or bigger monitor by applying the settings from the installation guide. Check those [here](../installation-guide#configurations). Try your changes in the game. Stop if it is enough.
2. Change our PI-CHO ENB to its more performance friendly version or to completely different ENB, which are meant to be more performance friendly. Those ENBs aren't as beautiful, but they are great for gameplay and don't go so hard on your computer. You can find the instructions about how to remove the current ENB [here](../installation-guide#in-game-adjustments) in quick tips. The most performance friendly ones I know are Truth ENB, Serio's ENB and Cathedral Minimalist ENB. It is up to you to find them, choose the best one for you and then follow the chosen one's instructions to apply it to your game. If you need some assistance to change it, feel free to ask in [TPF Discord server](https://discord.gg/m5kMrnHpwm)'s _#enb-talk_ channel. Try your changes in the game. Stop if it is enough.
3. Setup resolution scale according to the same instructions in the installation guide [here](../installation-guide#configurations).

> Can I play with a controller instead of mouse and keyboard?

Yep, it should be as easy as connecting a controller. The only potential issue would be lack of bindable hotkeys for mods.

---

> Can I change in-game real time clock format to 12 hour one?

1. Press on *INTERFACE* separator.
2. Double click on *KenMOD - Time On Loading Screen* mod.
3. Choose *Text files* tab.
4. In line 4, change _&twelveHourClock_ parameter to `1`.
5. Press on *Save* button or use `Ctrl` + `S` shortcut.
