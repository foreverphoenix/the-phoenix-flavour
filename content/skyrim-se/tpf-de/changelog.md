## Release 2.9.2

> 09.09.2022

**Is save compatible, but before updating you need to reset your perk points. Check the gameplay guide to learn how to do that.**

This time just an update to fix some sort of Nexus issues related to Adamant by just updating it.

### Updated Mods

* Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul
* Adamant - A Perk Overhaul
* Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon

## Release 2.9.1

> 07.09.2022

**Is save compatible.**

Just an update for some mods, fixes and tweaks for better gameplay. The biggest addition this time would be an introduction of a toggable friendly fire blocker, which mages are probably going to enjoy the most. Be sure to check the full changelog if you would like to learn more.

### Added Mods

* Simple Offence Suppression MCM - Block Friendly Fire
* Simple Offence Suppression Block Friendly Fire - Add-on
> Now you will do no damage to neutral NPCs by default. Press `O` to toggle friendly fire. If you disable friendly fire, allies will still tolerate you if you hit them, but only during combat. Feel free to report if you feel that I need to introduce some changes to this system.
* Pristine Vanilla Movement
> Some people didn't like our running and sprinting animations, so I have decided to come back to neutral classics, but not without the upgrade.
* Pretty Combat Animations - Magic Left Hand + Staff Right Hand Sprinting

### Removed Mods

* Elegant Candlelight
* Strange Runes
> Considering the fact that it can play not so well with a bunch of mods including even gameplay ones like Adamant and Mysticism.
* Undeath - XPMSSE - Strange Runes - Skeleton Patch
* Goetia Animations - Sprint
* Goetia Animations - Male Walk And Run
* Goetia Animations - Female Walk And Run

### Changes

* Turned off Gilded restoration time on new saves.
> Apparently that led to CTDs some people were experiencing. Thanks to JustIChris. To use this option on existing saves, open CLockwork's MCM and change Gilded resurrection time to 0.
* Turned on player's killmove immunity.
> It should have been turned on right from the beginning, but I guess I have forgotten about that. It also will resolve issues with CTDs some users were having, when NPCs gutted them out.
* Fixed Serana's hair being blue with hood.
* Fixed some rocks looking oddly in Shatterstone Scar.
> Thanks to Prizz.
* Nerfed Aligning the Matrix Weave spell.
* Added a note about how to build correctly Lakeview Manor.
* Made Pickaxe of the Impatient behave like other axes.

### Updated Mods

* Serana Dialogue Add-On
* Undeath - Classical Lichdom
* Undeath Classical Lichdom - The Ascension
* Xelzaz - Custom Fully Voiced Argonian Telvanni Follower
* Remiel - Custom Voiced Dwemer Specialist and Companion

## Release 2.9

> 07.08.2022

**New save is required.**

About sad things, at first. Even thou I have asked people to fill in the feedback survey, at the moment I was writing this only 39 people have filled it up. After the first feedback survey was closed, 50 people were able to help thou the list at that time has being in use by less people. I have decided not to do the feedback report. I guess many just people don't care, so I won't care about reporting too much either. :P Thanks to those people, who really tried, you will be able to partially get the report by reading the changelog. We are going to see how it goes later, but soon the survey will be closed.

About happy things. I would say this update is more about polishing our landscapes, while also improving some other aspects of the game. Now you will able to enjoy Happy Little Trees in their full glory together with mods, which compliment them like Happy Little Shrubs and our improved LOD. Also welcome another band of cats to our Skyrim from Khajiit Will Follow, new content addition. Some of items from mods became much more unique thanks to Snazzy Items series of mods, while bards are more happy, because not only Dragonborn troubles them not as often as always, but also because now they reside in their beautiful JK's Bards College. Also now you can toggle animated traversal action markers by pressing `;` button.

Also our main page and the guides are now on Phoenix's website, feel free to check it out - https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/tpf-de. I have tried to make each documentation piece even better than before, so let's hope it will help even more people than before.
