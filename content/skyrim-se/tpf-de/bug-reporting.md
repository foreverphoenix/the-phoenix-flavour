  How to report bugs for The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon's Edition.
---

To better understand and fix problems related to the modpack I would need to get a decent report, not something like *nothing is working wtf help plz*. 
In my opinion, it is a fair request, so, please, try your best to follow these simple rules and principles of bug reporting.

> **Warning**: Don't expect support for adding any other mods or for your modified setups of the modlist.

At first, everyone in the community are just people, 
who have their own life and work to do. I and other users can offer resources and tips about dealing with mod conflicts in the respective channels, 
but we aren't robots to know each and every mod and its consequences on the modpack. You can believe that mods are simply compatible out of the box if 
you didn't have any CTDs right at the start of the game, but it doesn't work like that. That is why you are here. I understand that can be scary for beginners, 
but it really is how it is. You will need some effort from your side in order to make the game more suited for yourself. So if you can add something, do it. If you can't, learn how to do it. Here are some good resources for the beginning - [ModdingSkyrim website](https://moddingskyrim.com/), 
[Lively's Learn How To Wiki](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/Main.md) and [Alhtro's Modding Resources](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Modding-Resources). If you tried, but something is still not right, 
you can ask for advice in [TPF Discord server](https://discord.gg/m5kMrnHpwm)'s _#tpf-de-modifications_ or _#mod-talk_ channels.

At second, support with in-game issues is offered in [TPF Discord server](https://discord.gg/m5kMrnHpwm)'s _#tpf-de-wabbajack-support_ and _#tpf-de-crash-reports_ channels.
> To get to these channels in the server, simply find _#role-settings_ channel and choose my role, new channels then will appear in the server's list.

At third, if another person reports any kind of issue you have too, mention that you are having the same issue.
That is important for me, because then I will know that issue is global and maybe I will need your help to resolve it. 

## Report Requirements

*   Confirmation that you haven't modified the modpack;
>   ENB, MCM, configuration mentioned in the installation guide and/or display related settings' adjustments are understandable if you know what you are doing. ANY other additions or changes - not.

*   Version of the fork;
>   Can be found on the first separator inside the mod organizer.  

*   Screenshot or video of the problem if appliable, crashlog if appliable;
>   When the problem is seeable, open the console (`~` key) and press on the problem to see maybe the console gives more information on the source of the issue. Then copy and paste in the report or just use any kind of video sharing service.

>   Crashlogs can be found inside */NetScriptFramework/Crash* folder in Overwrite. You can find Overwrite by scrolling all the way down in Mod Organizers' left pane.

*   Description of the problem (what, when, where);

*   How to repeat the issue if appliable.    
>   Remember that Skyrim is Skyrim, so if the issue can’t be repeated at least 3 times, I won’t be able to help.

### Examples for Your Bug Report

> A person has sent me a screenshot of a guard with black face and I
see all the data about the guard from console in *#tpf-de-wabbajack-support*.

*I am on the unmodified version 1.0 of TPF DE. Was going to Whiterun for the first time, right near the gate of the
city one of the guards has a black face.*

> A person has sent me a crashlog in *#tpf-de-crash-reports*.

I am on the unmodified version 1.0 of TPF DE. If I try to enter into Whiterun, the game crashes. Tried to enter 2 more times, but the issue is still there. Crashlogs were all the same._
