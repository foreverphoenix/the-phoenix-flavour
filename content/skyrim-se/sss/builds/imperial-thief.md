![Imperial Thief](/Pictures/sss/builds/imperial-thief.png)

In the busy city of Cyrodiil, where you were born and grew up, your heart yearned for adventure and mischief. Though your parents owned a hunting store called The Falcon's Roost, they insisted you help them instead of exploring the world beyond. Many believed your charm would make you a successful merchant, but you craved something more thrilling than the mundane life within the city walls.

When news of a civil war reached you, an idea sparked in your mind. You packed a bag, slung a bow across your shoulder, and set off towards the north. Along the way, you practiced with the tools you used to sell, pretending to be a skilled woodsman. You hoped to reach Skyrim, where the chaos of the war between the Stormcloaks and the Imperial Legion could provide cover for your secret plans.

Your plan was simple: deceive the soldiers by offering them information and resources, gain their trust, and then sneak away in the dead of night, taking some of their supplies with you. You repeated this scheme, playing the two sides against each other and earning a handsome profit for yourself.

But one day, while infiltrating a Stormcloak camp, you found yourself in the midst of a Legion ambush. The soldiers swiftly captured you alongside the rebels and accused you of "illegally crossing the border," when you couldn't provide proof of passage. Unaware of your scheme, your cover remained intact, giving you a glimmer of hope that perhaps you could talk your way out of this predicament...

## Summary

* **Complexity:** Low
* **Race:** [Imperial](## "Major Skill: Speech
Minor Skills: Block, Heavy Armor, One-handed, Restoration, Smithing
Red Diamond: Your Health, Magicka, and Stamina are increased by 25. You receive 10% better prices, and you find extra gold in your travels.")
* **Skills:**
  * **Offensive:** Archery
  * **Defensive:** Illusion, Light Armor
  * **Utility:** Security, Sneak, Speech
* **Attributes:**  
  Stamina is your key attribute as it's necessary for both sneaking and drawing your bow. Invest heavily in it to make sure you're not ever caught without the energy to run away when things go south. After that, a decent amount of Health protects you from the occasional hit or spell, and you'll need just enough Magicka to cast your handful of Illusion spells. 
  * **Health:** 3
  * **Magicka:** 2
  * **Stamina:** 5

At its core, the Imperial Thief is the quintessential "stealth archer," preferring to strike from far outside of an enemy's range and remain hidden for as long as possible. Use Speech and Security to amass a large pile of septims, use it to hire and outfit a stalwart mercenary to do your bidding, and then bolster them with Illusion magic and bard songs. At times a follower may seem unnecessary but bring them along anyway as they'll keep the enemies from focusing on you. Don't hesitate to throw your wealth at potions and other consumables. You can afford it.

## Perks

## Standing Stones

> Full standing stone information can be found on the [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-thief.webp">

#### The Thief (Guardian)

***Cheater's Luck:*** *Your Stamina is increased by 50, you move 10% faster, and you take 50% less damage from falling.*

Your Guardian Stone will be useful at every point of your adventure. Extra stamina and movement speed plays well into your stealth gameplay and, should situations really fall apart, you might be able to survive falls your pursuers cannot.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-lover.webp">

#### The Lover

***Lover's Touch:*** *Your Stamina regenerates twice as fast, but you take 25% extra damage while power attacking, drawing a bow, or casting a spell.*

Once you have enough raw Stamina, regeneration becomes the higher priority. The downside to The Lover doesn't concern you much as all since you have no intention of taking damage while drawing your bow. Later in the game you may have plenty of regeneration from your Light Armor perks and will start to see little benefit here.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-shadow.webp">

#### The Shadow

***Moonshadow:*** *You are 25% harder to detect while sneaking, and you deal 25% extra damage with sneak attacks and spells.*

It's no surprise that a sneakthief would find a home under the Shadow. This stone is especially useful in the early and mid-game where the 25% boost may be the deciding factor between being undetected and having your guts spilled. In the late game you'll still benefit from the boost to sneak attacks.

</details>

## Faith

> Full religion information can be found on the [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) description page.

The Divines have never been a large part of your life but it's impossible to live in Cyrodiil without basic familiarity with The Nine. Rather, The Eight. You keep your opinion on Talos to yourself, choosing to openly worship other Aedra such as *Akatosh*, *Dibella*, and *Zenithar* in your own distorted way.

<details>

#### Akatosh

*You gain 10% more experience.*

You can't go wrong with the chief deity of your pantheon. The extra experience can be especially valuable for leveling Security as opportunities for theft can be difficult early on. You don't have to follow all five commandments all the time, right?

#### Dibella

*Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 25%.*

You've always twisted the teachings of Dibella to suit your needs, but at the end of the day the Lady of Love, Beauty, Art, and Music encourages you to seek pleasure. Be sure to steal some beautiful artifacts during your travels and she'll keep you invigorated. 

#### Zenithar

*Your buying and selling prices are 10% better.*

Your love of coin naturally leads you to the God of Commerce. He does not support your deceit but praying to Zenithar will grant you deeper pockets nonetheless. Consider visiting a shrine before offloading your stash of gems.

</details>

## Spellbook

> Full magic information can be found on the [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-illusion.webp">

### Illusion

Dabbling in Illusion offers the Thief many benefits. With *Calm* as a starting spell you'll be able to reset some bad situations immediately out of Helgen, and the following spells will continue to add to your toolkit.

* **Courage (Novice+):** *Nearby living allies receive 25 extra Health, Magicka, and Stamina for 120 seconds.*  
  If you don't have a follower, hire one with all the money you have. Then use this to buff them on top of your bard song.

* **Muffle (Apprentice+):** *You move silently for 30 seconds.*  
  If you don't have the enchantment on your boots this is the next best thing. Silent footsteps makes it even harder for enemies to find you, which keeps you alive.

* **Command (Adept+):** *Living targets up to level 15 are placed under your command for 30 seconds.*  
  Turning one enemy against their friends does wonders for thinning the herd. Just be careful when buffing a commanded foe as they'll eventually turn back against you.

</details>

## Dragon Shouts

> Full dragon shout information can be found on the [Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) description page.

<details>

#### Battle Fury<sup>DB</sup>
*Cooldown: 60/90/120 seconds*  

* **Raan:** *All nearby allies move and attack 10% faster for 60 seconds.*
* **Mir:** *All nearby allies move and attack 15% faster for 60 seconds.*
* **Shaan:** *All nearby allies move and attack 20% faster for 60 seconds.*
* **Meditation:** *Battle Fury increases the Armor Rating of all nearby allies by up to 150.*

Another buff to add on top of *Courage* and your bard song. Even better if you have more than one ally, but even with just a follower this can greatly improve their effectiveness in combat.

#### Become Ethereal
*Cooldown: 60/90/120 seconds*  

* **Feim:** *You become ethereal for 10 seconds.*
* **Zii:** *You become ethereal for 20 seconds.*
* **Gron:** *You become ethereal for 30 seconds.*
* **Meditation:** *Become Ethereal restores Health over time.*

If the action gets too hot, use this to guarantee some safety and reposition as needed. With meditation it can also be used to restore Health whenever you need.

#### Call Dragon
*Cooldown: 5/10/300 seconds*

* **Od:** *No effect.*
* **Ah:** *No effect.*
*  **Viing:** *Summons Odahviing.*

This is quite situational as you need to complete the main quest and it only works outdoors, but it's perfect for difficult fights such as ones against other dragons. An essential ally that lasts until the fight's over? Summon him, buff him up, and get out of his way.

</details>

## Enchantments

> Full enchanting information can be found on the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) description page.

<details>

#### Weapon

* **Burden:** *Reduces enemy Movement and Attack Speed by 25% for 30 seconds.*
* **Paralyze:** *Living targets up to level 40 have a 25% chance to be paralyzed for 10 seconds.*
* **Frost Damage:** *Deals 30 Frost damage to Health and Stamina.*

These are intended for the enemies that can survive your sneak attacks. There's nothing wrong with adding damage to your arrows and *Frost Damage* will reduce their stamina if not slow them. *Burden* provides a more reliable debuff to their ability to retaliate, whereas *Paralyze* is a chance at an even stronger disable.

#### Head

* **Fortify Archery:** *You deal 25% extra damage with ranged weapons.*
* **Fortify Illusion Cost:** *Your Illusion spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Barter:** *You receive 20% better prices.*

A boost to your main source of damage is hard to ignore. Failing that, making your Illusion buffs cheaper may let you cast the next tier with less Magicka investment. Additionally, having a *Fortify Barter* cap while in town will let you squeeze a little more coin out of the merchants.

#### Chest

* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Health Regeneration:** *Your Health Regeneration is increased by 50%.*
* **Fortify Armor Rating:** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 100.*

This slot serves to bolster your defenses which, ideally, you don't need. Magic damage is always threatening so a chance to lessen that is valuable. You also lack natural Health Regeneration (though you can easily afford potions and food if that's), so that's also a worthwhile option. Lastly, Light Armor on its own may not get you to the armor soft-cap so you're welcome to boost that if you're worried about incoming physical attacks.

#### Gloves

* **Fortify Sneak Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with sneak attacks and spells.*
* **Fortify Security:** *You are 25% better at lockpicking and pickpocketing.*
* **Fortify Magicka Regeneration:** *Your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 50%.*

Empowering your sneak attacks is the clear winner here with *Fortify Security* being a clear 2nd place. If you don't have access to either, Magicka Regeneration is slightly useful if you find yourself casting often in combat.

#### Boots

* **Fortify Sneak:** *You are 25% better at sneaking.*
* **Muffle:** *You make 50% less noise while moving.*
* **Fortify Carry Weight:** *Your Carry Weight is increased by 50.*

Obvious choices for the thief. *Fortify Sneak* and *Muffle* will help keep you hidden, with the latter being an option if you don't want to use the Illusion spell. Additional Carry Weight helps you pick a place clean without being encumbered, if that's your style.

#### Necklace

* **Fortify Archery:** *You deal 25% extra damage with ranged weapons.*
* **Fortify Illusion Power:** *Your Illusion spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Fortify Illusion Duration:** *Your Illusion spells last 50% longer.*

If the boost to Archery is available, take it. Otherwise a boost to Illusion Power can stretch *Command* to influence higher level enemies, and Illusion Duration will make *Courage* last even longer. If you find a necklace with *Fortify Barter*, keep it handy for merchants.

#### Ring

* **Fortify Sneak Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with sneak attacks and spells.*
* **Fortify Sneak:** *You are 25% better at sneaking.*
* **Fortify Security:** *You are 25% better at lockpicking and pickpocketing.*

A very contested slot, you'll want to give priority to *Fortify Sneak Attacks*. The other options are nice icing on the cake but nothing trumps your desire to take enemies out of the equation with as few arrows as possible.
