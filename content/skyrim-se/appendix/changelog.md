## Release 3.4.5

> TBD

With this update Aetherius and Mundus were added to both WJ and manual guide to complement the existing suite of gameplay mods by SimonMagus.

And in other news: An optional **Legacy of the Dragonborn** profile was added to the Wabbajack version of TPF so that you get to have your V+ experience *and* the museum! Big thanks to Lively who made this happen.

#### Mod Installation

- **Landscape:** Removed The Elder Scrolls - Veydosebrom. The mod was updated and can no longer be used for our purposes.
- **Landscape:** Removed Cathedral - Veydosebrom Swamp Grass Addon, not compatible with recent Vey update.


## Release 3.4.4

> 10/08/2020

This is a fix-it for yesterday's update because I messed up a surprising amount of stuff some of which was already fixed yesterday but were included in the changelog for completion's sake.  All I can say in my defence is that 34°C in my flat is doing things to my brain.

**Mysticism and Adamant update:** Simon just released a huge update for Mysticism which is going to require us to update the CRP. Do not install the new versions of Mysticism and Adamant until Umgak had the time to update the CRP. You will be pinged on Discord or see the notification for the update on the Nexus if you are tracking TPF there. **Do not ask for an ETA.**

#### Initial Setup

- **Skyrim Script Extender:** Updated instructions, now supporting SKSE 2.0.19 (latest update).

#### Mod Installation

- **Apparel & Weapons:** Actually removed the (optional) flag from Open Face Guard Helmets.
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Trua - Minimalistic Faiths of Skyrim is no longer optional (no, seriously this time).

#### Finalisation

- **First Launch:** Removed ENB config section for Serio's ENB that is no longer necessary with Rudy ENB.

#### Appendix

- **Troubleshooting:** Added section for the enblocal.ini VSYNC and SSE Display Fixes conflict.

## Release 3.4.3

> 09/08/2020

With this update, we are switching to the recently released Rudy ENB for Cathedral Weathers which works better out of the box for our setup. It also utilises almost all ENB features without too much of a performance impact which is pretty impressive.

I've also finally gotten around to fixing up some [personal tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38348/) and putting them on Nexus. Of course they were added to the guide as well.

#### Initial Setup

- **Skyrim Script Extender:** Updated instructions, now supporting SKSE 2.0.18 (latest update).
- **INI Files:** Added instructions to increase particle count to 1500 under BethINI Detail.

- **Misc Structures:** Replaced Fences of Skyrim with SD's Farmhouse Fences.
- **Apparel & Weapons:** Open Face Guard Helmets is no longer optional (CRP dependency).
- **Apparel & Weapons:** Removed Open Face Guard Helmets - Plugin Replacer (conflicts addressed in the CRP).
- **Unique Artifacts:** Removed Better Shrouded Armor - Ancient Replacer Only - Plugin Replacer (conflicts addressed in the CRP).
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Trua - Minimalistic Faiths of Skyrim is no longer optional.
- **Non-Player Character:** Updated the customisation instructions for GDO (new console commands).
- **Non-Player Characters:** Updated FOMOD instructions for Nether's Follower Framework.
- **Combat & Encounters:** Added No Road Predators Redone.
- **Content Addon:** Temporarily removed It Beats For Her (hidden on the Nexus).

#### ENBSeries

- **ENB Preset Installation:** Renamed this step to have a generic name (because I keep changing presets).
- **ENB Preset Installation:** Swapped from Serio's ENB to Rudy ENB for Cathedral Weathers.
- **INI Tweaks:** Added optional instructions to enable volumetric lighting (godrays).

#### Resources

- **How To Update:** Added Skyrim Script Extender updating instructions.

#### Conflict Resolution Patch

- Fixed conflicts between Open Face Guard Helmets and WACCF.
- Fixed conflicts between Better Shrouded Armor - Ancient Replacer Only, WACCF, and Unique Item Tweaks.

## Release 3.4

> 14/07/2020

Welcome to the Make Phoenix Happy Again update, also known as MAPHA. Fuck Trump by the way (in case there are any doubts about my thoughts on the matter).

This update may well be controversial. A good deal of mods were removed in an effort to get back to my vision of a perfect vanilla-plus game. I fully expect that the changes will put off some users and I'm sorry for that, but it's for the best. Removing pretty much all the customisation options (not including optional mods) helps me a great deal with streamlining my work behind the scenes. I have a lot of polishing and small edits in my backlog that I never get to because I'm busy with a million other things.

The intention is not to make TPF smaller, per se. I will be adding a number of mods over the course of the upcoming updates and I do not plan to keep TPF small for the sake of it. It's the overall complexity and therefore the amount of work required that I need to keep reasonably small. I already struggle with a lack of focus and concentration, no need to make things harder for myself.

**Major changes:**

- Added a new Content Addon section that can be skipped completely. It includes the quest and companion mods that weren't yeeted in this update and will likely be expanded in the future.
- Interesting NPCs was yeeted for good. The quality of the mod is somewhat inconsistent and it doesn't blend in at all (and doesn't try to). It is by no means a "bad" mod, but it doesn't fit TPF.
- Arthmoor's Towns were yeeted for good. Supporting two optional sections is just too much work and I don't like them enough to add them to the new Content Addon.
- Obsidian Weathers was swapped out for Cathedral Weathers (again). In order to be able to control visuals better, I have decided to support only a single weather+ENB combo which will be Cath Weathers and Serio's ENB, ensuring working night eye visuals and decent grass blending.
- Wildcat was swapped out for Blade and Blunt. Not only does B&B complement the existing suite of SimonMagus gameplay mods (Adamant, Mysticism, and Arena), it is also more light-weight while at the same time (partly) replacing other tweaks.

**Structural changes:**

- Removed the numbering completely. The reason behind that is that with all the changes to the order of steps / mods I'm making, they are changing constantly anyway. Plus it's a lot of annoying work to keep them updated. So fuck 'em.
- Changed the order of mod installation steps AGAIN. Yes, I've been reshuffling them with basically every major update. I'd like to think that I'm getting closer and closer to perfection, though.
- Patches are no longer moved to the PATCHES separator. You can just leave them where they are in the installation order and the loadorder.txt will move the plugins to the correct spot.

#### Initial Setup

- This step was renamed to Initial Setup, simply because it looks better when the name is longer. Yeah...
- **Mod Organizer 2:** Added instructions to change the background color for the MO2 separators.
- **Mod Organizer 2:** Added instructions for the new OFFICIAL MASTER FILES separator.
- **INI Tweaks:** Updated BethINI Detail instructions (increasing Exterior Draw Distance to 8000).
- **ESM Cleaning:** Added instructions to move the Cleaned ESMs mod folder below the new OFFICIAL MASTER FILES separator.
- **Skyrim Realistic Overhaul:** This step was removed completely. SRO is no longer part of the guide.

## Release 3.3.1

> 13.06.2020

In this update, I primarily focused on restructuring the guide. A *lot* has happened behind the scenes. Step improved much of the theming, especially the dark theme and fixed some remaining issues. We are back on the old domain - thephoenixflavour.com - now with free Cloudflare SSL. It just redirects from foreverphoenix.github.io so it doesn't matter which URL you use. I've tinkering with more stuff for the guide content but realised fairly soon I was picking up way too many projects at once so most things were put on the backburner until the next update.

Because I've tried and moved and deleted so much stuff, the changelog is probably not complete. Sorry about that. This update kinda ran away from me and became a mess. I hope I didn't horribly break anything.

An new ENBSeries section was added that covers everything related to ENB, including instructions for a new default preset, Silent Horizons ENB. Visceral is still supported and listed under 04 Additional Presets. The mods from the ENB Particle Lights section were moved here to 05 Related Mods. ENB Light is now optional. With these changes, ENBSeries can easily be skipped.

#### Setup

- **6.3:** Updated BethINI instructions to remove ENB-related tweaks. Instructions to disable vanilla AO and increase particle count were moved to the new ENBSeries section.
- **7.2:** Adjusted instructions to link to the new download location for the CAO - Basic Profiles Pack.
- **9.3:** Added instructions to install the new CAO - SRO Profiles Pack.

#### Mod Installation

- Removed Remove Sneak Attack Sounds (feature included in Immersive Sounds - Compendium).
- Moved Frozen Electrocuted Combustion to Customisation.
- Moved ENB Particle Lights page to the new ENB section.
- **2.6:** Updated FOMOD instructions for Skyrim Water and Landscape Fixes (file update).
- **6.2:** Obsidian Weathers and Seasons MCM Patch is no longer optional.
- **21.21:** Realistic Skin Shader for Falmer and Hagravens is no longer optional.

#### ENBSeries

- Added this new section to cover everything related to ENBSeries.

#### Customisation
- **New Music:** This section was moved to the main guide.
- **Misc Mods:** Moved Frozen Electrocuted Combustion here.
- **Plugin Edits:** This section was removed for now. It only included a tweak for Dwemer Spectres which is no longer in the guide.
- **Removing ENB:** This section no longer exists as ENB itself was made completely optional.

## Release 3.3

> 07.06.2020

I re-added the mod installation instructions that I completely missed in the original website setup. Whoops! It's not like they're important or anything. You can find them [here](https://foreverphoenix.github.io/docs/02-setup/step-10/). It's not a straight copy-paste, I re-structured it and re-wrote parts as well. All "generic instructions" (using CAO, resaving plugins, etc) were moved to the [Basic Instructions](https://foreverphoenix.github.io/docs/07-resources/basic-instructions/) page under Resources.

The Mod Installation section itself was split up into four parts to avoid the ugly scrollbar.

The "Unpack Example.bsa" instructions previously contained instructions to delete the BSA afterwards. Some users missed this step and others got confused so I removed it and added instructions to delete the BSA directly to the mod instructions where appropriate. Should be pretty hard to miss now.

Some mods are now flagged as **(conditional)**, meaning they are optional but depend on other mods. You must install a **(conditional)** mod if you installed the mod that it depends on. Otherwise you must skip it.

And finally I added several new mods: **Immersive Sounds Compendium** with DylanJames' new AOS integration patch to the main guide and my favourite new music mods with a merged patch to the Customisation.

#### Setup

- **Step 7:** Removed the zEdit section. zEdit will be re-added to the guide once mator provides ESL support.

#### Mod Installation

- Removed Dwemer Spectres.
- Removed Dwemer Spectres - EBT No Bleeding and Other Fixes.
- Moved Adopt Aventus Aretino from Non-Player Characters (Step 26) to New Mechanics & Features (Step 36).
- **3.9:** Changed download instructions for Realistic Conversation (using a different main file).
- **8.5:** Arctic - Frost Effects Redux is no longer optional (conflict with ISC had to be resolved in the CRP).
- **36.8:** Re-added Irondusk's Saddlebags.
- **37.2:** Added Immersive Sounds - Compendium.
- **37.3:** Added Audio Overhaul - Immersive Sounds Integration.

#### Customisation

- **New Music:** Added this new section with five new music mods and a merged patch.

## Release 3.2.3

> 04.06.2020

Maintenance update.

#### Mod Installation

- **8.1:** Updated download instructions for Frozen Electrocuted Combustion (file update).
- **10.1:** Updated FOMOD instructions for EVT Alternate Branch Textures (file update).
- **37.1:** Updated download instructions for Audio Overhaul for Skyrim, removed instructions to download the EBT Patch (now integrated into the CRP).
- **37.1:** Removed instructions to delete the SKSE folder (no longer preset) and added instructions to delete the modgroups file for Audio Overhaul for Skyrim.

## Release 3.2.2

> 23.05.2020

Just a small maintenance update. Realistic Water Two received a big update today, then got hidden to fix oversights. It's back up now. You can probably expect a CRP update soon, but for now here are the updated instructions.

For those who use Arthmoor's additional towns from Customisation, there are now instructions for the Lanterns of Skyrim II patches. I missed them previously.

**Wabbajack users:** Stop pestering Lively about fixing the installer. When mods are updated, he has to update his own setup and recompile, and that takes time. Consider the fact that he has a life that includes more than updating the installer the second a mod update drops. Plus when a mod is hidden, like RW2 was today, there is nothing anyone can do and we all have to wait for the mod author to unhide the mod page. 

#### Mod Installation

- 1.9 Added instructions to delete a textures from the Particle Patch (fixes a bug where water spray would look much darker than intended).
- 9.7 Updated instructions for Realistic Water Two.
- 9.8 Added Realistic Water Two Patch Hub.

#### Customisation

- Added missing Lanterns of Skyrim II patch instructions for Arthmoor's Towns.

#### Load Order TXT

- Added new RealisticWaterTwo - Resources.esm

## Release 3.2.1

This is a small update, fixing some 3.2 oversights as well as bringing the guide up-to-date with the latest mod updates (of which there were several).

Most notably, BethINI and the guide's instructions for it were updated. The process of re-doing BethINI is quite simple and detailed in a new FAQ section, [How to redo INI files from scratch](https://github.com/foreverphoenix/the-phoenix-flavour/blob/master/The-Phoenix-Flavour-3-2/06-FAQ.md#how-to-redo-ini-files-from-scratch).
