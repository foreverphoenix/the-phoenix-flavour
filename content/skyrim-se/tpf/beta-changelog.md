## 5.0 Release Candidate 5

> TBD

I am very impressed with the recently released [Compass Navigation Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74484) which fits perfectly into the modern ARPG direction that I have been taking TPF. However, it still requires a patch for CoMAP and has some minor kinks to work out. For now, the mod and its requirements are included as optionals (in the UI Customisation section).

A new separator "EXPERIMENTAL" was added for mods that are being tested.

The Falkreath plaza situation was improved (less overgrown, fixed invisible tree), but it's not perfect.
