  Various options to improve performance in TPF.

## Performance Improvements

There are multiple ways to improve performance for TPF: The easiest and most effective option is switching to the performance profile which has less detailed LODs, toned-down INI files, and some alternative mod choices which should decrease the overall performance impact.

It is also possible to modify, swap, or disable ENB altogether to improve performance on either preset. The performance INIs can alternatively be applied to the main profile to squeeze out a few extra frames for those who would rather hold on to the higher quality object and tree LODs.

Finally, using Shadow Boost and / or downscaling to a lower resolution are options available to either profile.

### Expectations

TPF 5.0 features a number of city overhauls (JK's Skyrim, COTN, etc) as well as some other heavily overhauled locations (specifically the College of Winterhold). In those locations, performance drops will always occur, at least on less powerful machines. The tweaks available on this page may decrease the overall impact but are not guaranteed to bring everyone's performance up to a stable 60FPS.

## Performance Profile

The quickest way to improve performance is switching to and playing on the performance profile. **Please do this before starting your playthrough.**

### Differences

The Performance profile is different from the main profile in the following ways:

- Embers XD with optimised particle light and vanilla flame
- Performance LODs for Happy Little Trees
- Tweaked copy of Defaulto ENB instead of Rudy ENB
- Cathedral Landscapes for more performance-friendly grass
- Disabled some ENB particle lights mods
- Generated DynDOLOD with reduced settings
