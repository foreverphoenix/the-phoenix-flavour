## About The Phoenix Flavour

**The Phoenix Flavour** (TPF) used to be a modding guide and is now a Wabbajack list for Skyrim Special Edition. In its present iteration, TPF is the attempt to bring a decade old classic to modern action RPG standards with updated graphics and gameplay, as well as new content to enjoy.

> TPF 5.0 is currently in open beta. More information as well as download links are available on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xCPxJFbCTS).

### Features

- There will be features here. I promise.

Please check the [Documentation](/skyrim-se/tpf/documentation/) for more details on the included mods, or check out the [Load Order Library](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/the-phoenix-flavour-50-wip) page for the full mod list and load order.

### Performance

The default TPF profile will come with a substantial performance impact over vanilla. Though performance-friendly options were prioritised where possible, the list does feature a full ENB preset, a demanding grass overhaul, and several city overhauls.

However, a performance-optimised profile is included with options to further improve the framerate.

#### To install TPF, please follow the [Installation Guide](/skyrim-se/tpf/installation/).
