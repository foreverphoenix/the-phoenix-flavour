Just the most recent mod updates. SME is still on 1.6.353

#### Mod Changes

## Release 1.5.1

> 29/09/2022

- Fixed Wabbajack installer failing on missing CCs

## Release 1.5

> 28/09/2022

For the forseeable future, SME will continue to use **SSE 1.6.353** until all mods have been updated. However, I recompiled with the latest version of Skyrim in my Steam folder, meaning that users also need to have the latest version to install SME. Wabbajack will downgrade the copy of the game in your Game Root folder. This way, you don't have to downgrade your Steam installation.

- Updated MCM Helper to 1.3.3
- Updated SSE Display Tweaks to 0.5.11
- Updated powerofthree's Tweaks to 1.7.1
- Updated Enhanced Reanimation to 1.5.0
- Updated Face Discoloration Fix to 1.0.3
- Updated Sound Fix for Large Sector Drives to 3
- Updated Assorted Mesh Fixes to 0.73
- New separator "Console Improvements" (moved some mods around)
- Redownloaded the mandatory CCs (as WJ will otherwise downgrade them)
- Recompiled with latest Skyrim SE version
- Recompiled with Wabbajack 3

#### Website

## Release 1.2.1

> 31/07/2022

## Release 1.2

> 30/07/2022

With this update, I migrated the SME documentation to the new Skyrim SE Lists section of the website which breaks all links. I fixed those I could think of but might have missed some in which case please let me know on Discord.

In other news, I disabled the Fix Game Registry Path plugin for now. It is very convenient for LOOT (which uses the registry key to locate the game), but isn't really needed for anything else and also breaks Creation Organizer. On top of that, it becomes cumbersome to constantly update the path when swapping between modded setups. I found a different solution for making LOOT work.

#### Mod Changes

- Added Quest Journal Limit Bug Fixer
- Added Enhanced Invisibility
- Added Enhanced Reanimation
- Added Combat Music Fix SKSE
- Added Keywords Fixed
- Added dunPOISoldiersRaidOnStart Script Tweak
- Added Modern Toggle Walk-Run Fix - With Cobb Controlmap Fix
- Updated Wrye Bash to 310 (non-beta)
- Updated bundled ENBSeries binaries
- Removed the Bashed Patch that SOMEHOW snuck into the Data folder
- Removed Modern Toggle Walk-Run Fix
- Fix Game Registry Path is now disabled by default

#### Website Changes

- **Introduction:** Fixed loadorderlibrary.com link for SME under Features
- **Installation:** Improved the MO2 prerequisites section and added NET 4.8
- **Installation:** Removed the NET 5.0 requirement (no longer needed)
- **Installation:** Added LOOT post-installation setup instructions
- **Installation:** Added zEdit post-installation setup instructions
- **Recommendations:** Removed Blood (Green) Dragon Texture Fix (included in the USSEP)
- **Recommendations:** Added Farm Hat 01 Clipping Fix

## Release 1.1

> 21/07/2022

Following feedback, I decided to do some pruning where more controversial "fixes" were concerned and add a few more tools. Some of these I have not been using extensively before and while I tested them all, I cannot exclude the possibility that I missed something in the setup. If that is the case I will fix it asap.

Including a section of fix mods is very difficult as many are somewhat subjective or not compatible with / required for every setup. For one mod in particular, I have had people both very happy about its inclusion and completely opposed to it. So I decided to yeet most mods that could possibly be controversial and wrote up [a list of recommendations](/sme/recommendations) instead. Refer to that, please.

Thanks to Tyler/Night_Thastus and Parapets in particular for your feedback and recommendations!
