## Release 2.6

> 28/06/2022

So the USSEP recently updated and, as previously announced, now requires the four free creations (Survival, Fishing, Saints & Seducers, Rare Curios). But not to worry - I cleaned out the dependencies so that the default profile remains free of CC content. However, this development encouraged me to add support for Survival and Fishing to the CC profile which are the big additions of this update.

The CC profile now also supports:

- Survival
- Campsite
- Fishing
- Farming

## Release 2.5.1

> 08/06/2022

Here is another smaller update for you guys as we are ever so slowly inching toward full Creation Club support. Of course, we're not quite there yet (check [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vPH-HsEsVcw-ipbHl3Am0FL0jwF6JiR7Z-8zqWcKWvU/edit#gid=0) to see the progress so far). If you are running the CC profile, all you need to do to update is run the Creation Organizer again as per the instructions on the [Creation Club](/lotf/creation-club/) page. This will move the new CCs automatically from your data folder into Mod Organizer 2.

As ever, the update is save-safe.

## Release 2.5

> 25/05/2022

- Adventurer's Backpack
- Horse Armor - Elven
- Horse Armor - Steel

> 16/04/2022

Another round of New Stuff (tm) in honour of [this amazing showcase of LOTF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hru8F0QRwQ) by **DroppedIceCream**. In addition to a bunch of mod updates, I added support for more creations and simplified the instructions for installing said creations.

All creations adding unique artifacts are now supported:

## Release 2.2

> 27/02/2022

This update took much longer than expected as I am just swamped with uni stuff at the moment.

I hope to add support for a greater number of creations in the next update.

## Release 2.1

> 07/01/2022

I hadn't planned to update LOTF again, but the recent SSE update made it necessary. This update was compiled with SSE 1.6.353.0 which is the latest version so please do not use the downgrade patcher.

#### Mod Changes

- Added Optional Round Farmhouse Posts
- Added Major Cities Mesh Overhaul
- Added 3D Whiterun Trellis
- Added 3D Riften Trellis and Roofs
- Added 3D Solitude Market Trellis
- Updated DynDOLOD to Alpha 60
- Updated SSE Display Tweaks to 0.5.8
- Updated DynDOLOD Resources Alpha 17
- Updated Assorted Mesh Fixes to 0.41.1

- Restored LOTF's tweaked version of Minimal ENB for Obsidian Weathers thanks to Slim
- Reinstalled MO2 plugins that were lost after the update (deorder's, LOOT Preventifier)
- Disabled the Sort Plugins button in MO2 (another change lost after updating)

*Note that while I did update DynDOLOD, I did not regenerate LODs for this update.*

#### Website Changes

- **Installation:** Updated latest version number.

## Release 2.0.2

> 02/01/2022

Of course I forgot to update the SSE version shenanigans in the Installation instructions and probably caused quite a bit of headache because of that. LOTF 2.x requires the *latest* version of Skyrim SE installed in your Steam folder. Thanks to JanuarySnow for reminding me!

#### Website Changes

- **Installation:** Fixed a fairly critical oversight, clarified that latest SSE version is required for installing LOTF

## Release 2.0.1

> 01/01/2022

So the initial 2.0 release was unplayable, cool.

After fixing 2.0 and realising that I was still unable to compile, I found out that at some point I had yeeted my backup of the modified Minimal ENB for Obsidian Weathers that LOTF has been using alongside Wander. I ultimately just reinstalled the preset and applied the tweaks that I still remembered but it's probably not all of them. I honestly don't know. Either way, I recommend The Truth ENB and the only reason it's not the default preset is because it was taken off the Nexus.

#### Mod Changes

- Obsidian Weathers and related mods are now actually included
- Replaced texture BSAs in Stock Game folder with UPOT (Unofficial Performance Optimised Textures)
- Fixed an error in the WABBAJACK_IGNORE_FILES.txt that caused the entire Stock Game folder to be ignored
- Reinstalled Minimal ENB for Obsidian, some tweaks were probably lost

## Release 2.0

> 31/12/2021

- Support for **Obsidian Weathers and Seasons** as an alternative to Wander.
- Instructions for **swapping out** the ENB preset for Truth ENB **or disabling ENB** altogether.
- Inclusion of **Nemesis** as well as a stripped down XPMSSE for **Simple Dual Sheath**.
- Better water (**Realistic Water Two**), readable road signs (HD Road Signs), new grass overhaul (Enhanced Landscapes).
- New **Creation Club profile** with support for 14 Creations (so far).
- New **performance profile** with lighter INI settings and DynDOLOD setup (not compatible with CC profile).

LOTF 2.0 utilizes the "Best of both worlds" downgrade patcher in order to be able to stay on SKSE 2.0.20 for SSE 1.5.97.0 (pre-AE). This is because not all of LOTF's SKSE-dependent mods (25/38) were updated yet. With the "best of both worlds" patcher all game files other than the executable are from the latest AE version though, meaning all assets for new creations are present and AE content can be used.

**Removal of Immersive HUD:** Skyrim's UI is fairly unintrusive already, but the ability to disable the HUD still comes in handy for taking screenshots. iHUD unfortunately has some issues with the crosshair (it sometimes vanishes completely for me) so I decided to just replace it with Luca's version of fadingsignal's Hide UI. It completely disables the UI at the press of a button so it doesn't ruin a pretty screenshot.

#### How To Update

Before updating LOTF to 2.0 for an ongoing playthrough, please load your latest save and follow these instructions:

- In the **Immersive HUD** MCM, please uncheck **iHUD Active** to completely turn off iHUD.
- Make sure you are in an exterior location and open the **DynDOLOD** MCM.
- Uncheck **DynDOLOD is active** and wait for the confirmation box to pop up.
- Go into any interior cell and save, then quit the game.
- In Mod Organizer 2 under the **CRP & PATCHER OUTPUTS** separator, uncheck the **TexGen** and **DynDOLOD** outputs.
- Load your save, click **OK** to missing masters, and create a new manual save.

Now you can safely update LOTF through Wabbajack and continue your playthrough.

## Release 1.6.1

> 22/11/2021

Quick update to fix issues with ENB, it should download properly now. Sorry for the inconvenience!

#### Mod Changes

- Compiled with and requiring SSE 1.6.323 (latest)
- Updated ENBSeries binaries (no version number change)
- Updated Charge Dialogue Fix to 1.2
- Updated Assorted Mesh Fixes to 0.34

#### Website Changes

- **Installation:** Updated required version of SSE to 1.6.323 (latest)

## Release 1.6

> 20/11/2021

This update introduces Tate Taylor's superbrain solution for Skyrim AE. It was compiled with the latest version of SAE (1.6.318.0) in my actual root folder and LOTF's current supported version of SSE (1.5.97.0) in the Stock Game folder. With the small addition of meh's DLL Plugin Loader for some immensely big-brained binary patching action this allows LOTF to function without having to run the downgrade patcher first. The version in the Stock Game folder installed and used by LOTF will still be 1.5.97.0 until I eventually update to the latest one.

**Yes, I intend to update LOTF to SSE 1.6.318 / AE.** However, quite a few mods need updating first (currently the counter is at 13/40 and rising steadily). For more information on LOTF 2.0 / AE, please check my [November 2021 Update](https://www.patreon.com/posts/november-2021-58852886) post on Patreon.

The Immersive HUD MCM is now automated for anyone starting a new game (it does nothing for ongoing playthroughs). I also fixed the moreHUD Settings Loader (made a dumb mistake) so it should work as expected now.

**LATE NOTE:** LOTF 1.6 actually requires Skyrim SE 1.6.318.0 in your own root folder in order to install it. Updated the instructions accordingly.

## Release 1.5

> 13/11/2021

This is mostly a maintenance update although I did add the fantastic **CoMAP** by Jelidity and Parapets as well as a brand-new installation guide. It is much shorter than the previous one on account of the Stock Game Folder system allowing us to skip several steps. It also accounts for the AE downgrade patcher.

Please for the love of Talos don't ask me when LOTF will get AE support.

#### Mod Changes

- Added Common Marker Addon Project (CoMAP)
- Updated SSEEdit to 4.0.4
- Updated SSE Display Tweaks to 0.4.17

#### Website Changes

- **Screenshots:** Added new screenshots and headings for the side bar so the page is easier to navigate

## Release 1.4.2

> 24/10/2021

The butterfly update: In LOTF 1.4.2, I am adding some mods that improve critters in the world, how they move and where they can land. Did you know that Monarch butterfly wings were [upside down](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/54485-2-1401481905.jpg) in vanilla?

Also you no longer get my custom keybinds. I fixed that.

#### Mod Changes

- Added Umgak's Hanging Elves Ear Mesh Fix
- Added Wiseman303's Critter Fixes
- Added Butterflies Land True
- Added Butterflies Unchained
- Added Simplicity of Snow - Blended Roads Patch
- Updated Assorted Mesh Fixes to 0.32
- Updated Radiant - Candles to 2.1.0
- Updated DynDOLOD to 3 Alpha 53 (LOD was not regenerated)
- Fixed a dumb typo in the WABBAJACK_IGNORE_FILES.txt file name

## Release 1.4.1

> 16/10/2021

After yesterday's larger update, I have some fixes and previously missed mod updates for you today. Save safe, etc.

#### Mod Changes

Note that I only updated DynDOLOD and the DynDOLOD Resources, but did not regenerate LODs.

- Updated Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes to 6.3
- Updated DynDOLOD Resources to Alpha 15
- Updated Shadows of Sunlight to 0.5
- Updated Simplicity of Snow to 0.4
- Updated ENBSeries (no version change)
- Updated DynDOLOD to 3 Alpha 48
- Added fixed moreHUD Settings Loader script (moreHUD MCM should no longer fail to initialise)
- Added my ControlMap_Custom.txt to the list of files ignored by Wabbajack so my keybinds are no longer applied to users' setups 

## Release 1.4

> 15/10/2021

This update brings a number of new addition that fit nicely within the scope of LOTF. I found that I could absolutely not live without **moreHUD** and added the mod along with a custom preset. You will now be able to see whether you already read a book, whether a book is a skill book and, if it is, which skill it improves. For enemies, their level and soul type is now displayed next to their health bar. When hovering over items that can be picked up, there will now be an indicator in the bottom right corner, informing you about your current carry capacity, how much weight the items would add, and whether you already have any items of the same type.

**Please note:** The moreHUD preset is applied automatically only in *new games*. In your ongoing playthroughs, please load it manually via the mod's MCM.

Visually, LOTF 1.4 adds the following improvements:

- Thanks to the new **Radiant - Candles** mod, candles now give off proper light and illuminate surrounding objects. You can find a comparison slider [here](https://imgsli.com/NzcwMjA). Note that this feature required me to enable Complex Particle Effects in ENB as well as increase the particle count INI setting which may cause a slight performance drop on low-end systems. However, I did not enable the Big Range setting so there will be no noticeable FPS loss on most PCs.
- The vanilla woven fences were notorious for their flickering which the Static Mesh Improvement Mod addresses but does not fully fix. I chose to add Mathy's meshes instead, **Skyrim 3D Misc - Woven Fence**, which are a lot more loose and should fix the flickering completely. There is a comparison slider [here](https://imgsli.com/NzcwMjE).
- Various assets related to spiders were fixed and improved by the mod **WEBS**. The titular spider webs are of higher quality and should no longer appear overbright. The mod also replaces the meshes for webbed dead bodies as some of them were outright broken in vanilla.
- **Simplicity of Snow** vastly improves the visuals and logic of projected snow on various objects. As a lightweight replacement for the more involved Better Dynamic Snow and No Snow Under Rooftops mods, it is well suited for LOTF's lightweight nature.

**The latest version of the .NET 5.0 Runtime is required.** This is because of the Scrambled Bugs update which now relies upon this. Please download it from [the official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) and install it before updating LOTF.

## Release 1.3

> 15/09/2021

This is a smaller update and will likely be the last one for the time being. I fixed the message when trying to drop a quest message so it does not just now show the raw string (was missing a dependency), removed the mod causing the purple waterfalls (couldn't be bothered to find the missing texture), updated a bunch of mods, and regenerated TexGen, DynDOLOD, and Occlusion with the latest version of DynDOLOD. I believe LOTF is in a pretty good place for now.

## Release 1.2

> 10/09/2021

After some deliberation, I swapped out the previous skin overhauls (Lucid and Vitruvia) for the Tempered Skins combination. They are closer to vanilla and look better with LOTF's lighting.

I also fixed the purple waterfalls and improved the [book interface](https://imgsli.com/NzAzOTc).

## Release 1.1

> 06/09/2021

**Fixing the intro dialogue:**

So apparently increasing horse speed will mess up the intro carriage ride because the horses are too fast for the dialogue - who would have thought? I reverted *only* the forward walk speed tweak from Simple Horse Tweaks to vanilla which should fix it.

**New ENB preset:**

I also added an **ENB** preset in this update. If The Truth was still on the Nexus, it would have been part of the initial release, but with things as they are I had elected not to use an ENB at all. However, after some playing I realised that vanilla ambient occlusion crushes blacks on the character and some shadows to the point where it's just ugly as hell.

Thankfully, @Shade088 from our Discord server recommended [Minimal ENB for Obsidian Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37098) which turns out to be the perfect alternative. It does not affect colours (so you can also use it with any weather mod), but implements all those little improvements that ENB can bring to the table such as ambient occlusion. @Shade088 also provided tweaked water values to hide the distant water seams so I didn't even have to figure these out myself.

Since LOTF is using the Stock Game folder system, ENB is already installed for you and you do not have to move any files.

**This update is save-safe.**

#### Mod Changes

- Added deorder's MO2 plugins (largely for myself)
- Added Minimal ENB for Obsidian Weathers
- Added ENBSeries binaries
- Added Skyrim Particle Patch for ENB
