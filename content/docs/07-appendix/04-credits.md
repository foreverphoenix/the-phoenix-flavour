### The Website

- Thanks to **Step** for setting up Hugo and Docsy, for creating the dark theme, and for putting up with my constant pestering and feature requests.
- Thanks to **Kai** for implementing the theme toggle so that alsa and I and that one other user can use light mode, yay!
- Thanks to **vaecors** for reminding me that Hugo would work perfectly with the markdown version of the guide and supporting us in setting it up.
- Thanks to **erri120** without whom I might never have tried Github which turned out to be the perfect solution.

### Further Acknowledgements

- Thanks to **Lexy** whose guide inspired me in many ways and with whom I've enjoyed some great conversations about the woes of maintaining a modding guide.
- Thanks to **halgari** and the Wabbajack team with whom we've been in touch since its inception and who have been very accomodating and supportive.
- Thanks to **alt3rn1ty** for their manual ESM cleaning instructions (included in Setup, Step 8.5).
- Thanks to **Dodger** for gifting me lifetime Nexus Premium and **Kedavix** for the Snagit license, both of which are tremendously helpful.
- Thanks to all the mod authors and fellow guide authors who have collaborated / communicated with us: SimonMagus, VictorF, mnikjom, Nathan, Slidikins, and all the others.
- Thanks to all the wonderful people on our Discord server, particularly those who have been around and active for a long time.
- Thanks to my Patreons and everyone who donated over PayPal or by other means over the past years!
