## Main Menu Mods

Everytime you start the game, you will spend approximately three seconds in the main menu (which is how long it takes to press NEW GAME or CONTINUE). That's why you should definitely mod it in some way.

With ReCleaned menu (an optional mod which is part of the main guide), the main menu has already been decluttered and freed of any Creation Club ads. The background smoke has been removed as well (through another optional mod) which will look much better with custom main menu replacers.

The two types of mods for main menus are music replacers and background replacers. Sometimes both are packaged together. The file names and paths are:

- `Data\music\mus_maintheme.xwm`
- `Data\textures\interface\objects\mainmenuwallpaper.dds `

Any other files packaged with a main menu replacer you can safely delete. If you want only the music track or the background image, delete the other file.

#### Monitor Proportions

Most menu replacers are made for 16:9 resolutions (1920x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2160) unless stated otherwise. Keep that in mind when selecting a background replacer. Ultra widescreen monitors are not usually supported by background replacer mods. While 16:10 are extremely rare nowadays, MistValkyrie offers versions for those propertions in Mist's Anthology Menus.

#### Do It Yourself

It is fairly easy to convert any song to XWM and use it as a background track. Creating a custom background wallpaper is a little more involved but not complex at all. I will elaborate on this in the future.

#### Main Menu Randomizer

If you just cannot settle for one main menu replacer, why not randomize them so you get a different one every time you launch the game? With [Main Menu Randomizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33574) you can do just that. Note that I haven't written instructions for it yet so you'll have to figure out how to use it on your own. Standard main menu replacers will have to have their file paths and names updated to work properly with the Randomizer.

#### Mod Order

Completely irrelevant but as usual I would recommend grouping main menu replacers with the **INTERFACE** separator.

#### Recommendations

- [DRELDYN's Original Main Menu Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6992?tab=files), my personal favourite and the one I usually use. I do delete the sound file though, and keep the vanilla theme.
- [Mist's Anthology Menus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/744?tab=files), beautiful collection by MistValkyrie, includes both music tracks and wallpapers.
- [Main Menu and Music Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30144?tab=files)
- [Relaxing Main Menu Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11675?tab=files)

## Font Replacer

Changing the primary font in Skyrim is not quite as simple as replacing `fonts_en2.swf`, you also need to edit the `fontconfig.txt`. Through this config file you can define separate fonts for the console, books, notes, and the general UI. Thankfully, font replacement mods always come with this file tweaked accordingly.

The most popular and comprehensive font overhaul mod is **Sovngarde** which was created specifically for Skyrim SE. Before Sovngarde was released, I used and loved the **Fertigo Pro** font replacer and currently I am enjoying the simplicity of the **Roboto** font.

I have compiled a list of font replacers that I like although you can find more on the Nexus. **You can only use one of them at a time.**

[Monospace fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font) are preferable since otherwise perk and inventory descriptions might be cut off. 

#### Mod Order

Irrelevant. I recommend grouping font replacers with the **INTERFACE** separator.

#### Recommendations

- [Sovngarde - Mist's Font Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/386?tab=files), I recommend the "Light" version.
- [Main Font Replacement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14356?tab=files), I recommend the "Fertigo Pro" option.
- [Roboto Font Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1779?tab=files), very clean, my current favourite.

## SkyUI Icon Replacer

To further customise your interface, or, more specifically, SkyUI, **ElSopa** created a whole collection of icon replacers. There are some for the inventory categories as well as the active effects displayed in the HUD. While they are standalone, you might want to match your choice of icon replacers for inventory categories and active effects.

Since they overwrite each other, you can only have one of each active at a time (one replacer for the inventory category items, and one for the active effects).

#### Mod Order

Irrelevant. I recommend grouping font replacers with the **INTERFACE** separator.

#### Inventory Category Icon Replacer

- [SkyUI Colored Category Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23193)
- [ElSopa - Animated Celtic Icons for SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22938)

## SkyUI Config Tweak - Equipped Items On Top (optional)

SkyUI Config Tweak keeps the equipped items "stickied" to the top of the inventory page. Personally I find it very annoying but it's an easy addition for those who like it.
