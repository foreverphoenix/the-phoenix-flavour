## Important Notice

**This list is currently not available.**

## Release 2.8.3

> 18/09/2023

This update should be save-safe.

Because Diamond City Radio Extended was updated you need to restart its quest. Open the console and run the following commands:

```
stopquest radiodiamondcity
startquest radiodiamondcity
```

I fixed various item naming rule issues (melee weapon mods not being separated from weapon name, Silver Submachine Gun, Heavy/Sturdy ruleset being above legendary for armor, Vault-Tec Workshop pipboys). Unfortunately, these will not work retroactively; however, you can manually add tags to your armors, weapons, and clothing by renaming them at a workbench.

A tweak was added to significantly reduce the chance of finding empty ammo containers.

## Release 2.8

> 19/02/2023

While I was gone for a few months, the FO4 modding community was busy and a few new interesting releases as well as a ton of updates have now made their way to WTP. Most notably, the LOD generation process has become more intricate for better results (TexGen for FO4 is a thing now).

Good news, Steam Deck people! Follow [this excellent guide](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux/wiki/Fallout-4:-Welcome-to-Paradise) to install WTP on your Steam Deck and play on the go.

Tools (FO4Edit, FO4LODGen, etc) are no longer included with WTP. This is a change I am slowly making across all my lists (with the obvious exception of SME) as it is becoming quite cumbersome and, frankly, unnecessary to maintain 4+ different installations of the same tools. If you want to modify anything about WTP (or my other lists) then you should know what you are doing; that includes knowing which tools you need and how to install them.

## Release 2.7

> 05/11/2022

With the addition of **More Sensible Modification Perk Requirements**, certain upgrades will now be more different procure. This is especially true for scopes which require the Science perk. In the early game, a good tactic is picking up scoped guns from enemies and taking off the scope to put them on your own weapons.

Plenty of new options were added to Configurable Hotkeys in recent updates. Feel free to check through the MCM and set up hotkeys for whatever you find useful.

The Allow Renaming option in the What's Your Name? MCM is now enabled in the WTP MCM Preset. If you do not like the name that was randomly generated for a settler, you can now cycle through the list with the same hotkey until you have found a better one.

I removed the specific MCM settings for ultrawide support as the FallUI suite of mods now automatically adjusts to your resolution.

**This update is save-safe.**

## Release 2.6.5

> 15/10/2022

Well, it happened, I started playing Fallout 4 again. What does this mean for WTP? For one, there will likely be no updates requiring a new game in the near-ish future since I want to keep playing the latest version. It also means that there is a better chance of me finding lingering, unreported issues and oversights (there were a couple clothing items without sorting tags, fixed now), and making adjustments. I am currently tinkering with a custom FallUI HUD preset which is included in WTP and can be selected in the MCM (only minor changes from vanilla so far).

This update was compiled with Wabbajack 3.

- Reverted low health heart beat sound fx behaviour to vanilla

## Release 2.6.1

> 16/08/2022

All I wanted to do was fix WJ installations failing due to the xLODGen archives, but then DoubleYou went and published more LOD improvements, so I had to regenerate terrain and object LODs, and things kind of escalated from there. Anyway, this is a semi-minor update that is of course safe save and makes (distant) trees look better, especially on Far Harbor.

**KNOWN ISSUE:** Currently there is an empty category in the Crafting (chem) Bench. If you click it YOU CAN'T BACK OUT so, uhh, don't click it. I have no idea what is causing it but I'll investigate further.

## Release 2.6

> 12/08/2022

**This update requires a new save.**

WTP now features [Perk Up - Lightweight Perk Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/62843), one of a collection of mods by SpringHeelJon for his new Wabbajack list, [FUSION](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/62880), which you should definitely check out!

I also added [Kezyma's Root Builder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31720) which means moving the Game Folder Files is no longer required. Instead, all files that need to be inside the root folder will be moved there by the plugin when you launch the game, and removed again when you close it. Existing WTP users should clear out existing GFF files from their root folder.

Also I finally got around to generating custom terrain and object LOD for this update.

## Release 2.5

> 30/07/2022

This update is coming with some site restructuring: The entire WTP documentation was moved to the new Fallout 4 Lists section and as a result, all links are broken. I fixed those I could find, let me know if you find any that are still leading into the void. I also took the opportunity to restructure the pages somewhat, particularly the Documentation.

I also removed the mod Facials for Everyone because of persistent performance issues. Fallout 4 has an issue where long levelled lists for NPC templates considerably degrade performance, so Facials offered a "lite" version with a shorter LList for that reason and WTP was using that. But I still got plenty of reports for stutters that were fixed by disabling facials and decided to boot the mod.

Also puddles were re-enable and should no longer flicker. Yay!

#### Mod Changes

- Added Simple Puddle Reflection Flicker Fix
- Added Gloomy Glass - All Transparent Materials Revised

- **Documentation:** Merged several separate sites together into one longer documentation
- **Known Issues:** Added "brown faces" problem and solution

## Release 2.4

> 17/06/2022

It was recently brought to my attention that some DLC weapons have completely broken names which turned out to have been due to a very silly oversight on my part. This update fixes that, but unfortunately it will not work retroactively. If you already went to Far Harbor and / or Nuka World, any weapons that already generated will have the incorrect names. Sorry about that.

In other news, I added a few recent releases, mostly adding new snap points to meshes to make settlement building a smoother experience. Syringer ammo is now easier to craft (requiring base ingredients rather than Antifreeze Bottles etc) and will be sorted in their own roll-up (sub) menu in the Aid tab. You can quit accidentally poisoning yourself now.

If you don't want to start a new game for this, you need to manually restart the quest for Diamond City Radio Extended ingame. Open the console and run the following two commands:

```
stopquest radiodiamondcity 
startquest radiodiamondcity
```

#### Mod Changes

- Added Atom Cats Drag Race Start Fix
- Added CC's UHD APC 4K (packed into a BA2)
- Added Companion Thoughts Overhaul
- Added Syringer Ammo Simpler Ingredients
- Added Proctor Teagan Sells BOS Clothing
- Added Garden Plot Snap
- Added Useful Posts
- Added Warehouse Corner Wall Snap
- Added Warehouse to Wall Snap
- Added Snappy Half Walls
- Updated BethINI to 3.6.1
- Updated Cathedral Assets Optimizer to 5.3.13
- Updated Buffout 4 to 1.26.2
- Updated Wetness Shader Fix to 3.6

## Release 2.3.3

> 30/04/2022

Small update. Yes, it's save-safe.

#### Mod Changes

- Updated Previsibines Repair Pack to 0.57.4.2

#### Website Changes

- **Installation:** Added the Performance INI section
- **INI Files:** Moved notes on INI settings to their own page
- **Known Issues:** Added "Performance Issues" section

## Release 2.3.1

> 28/03/2022

This is a quick maintenance update for WTP because I'm a dummy and deleted the enbseries zip from the CDN. I did take the opportunity to add a new, high-res map retexture which required me to adjust the MCM settings for FallUI Map a bit. While I was at it, I changed the Wait hotkey to CTRL + T so it doesn't accidentally trigger while renaming a weapon. Finally, I also regenerated INIs with the new version of BethINI, hope I didn't forget about any custom tweaks. I may add performance INIs in the future if people find this set to be too demanding.

- **MCM Settings:** Updated Baka Wait Anywhere settings and added FallUI Map settings.

## Release 2.3

> 27/02/2022

**New save required.** Please also overwrite the Game Folder Files!

This update adds a few cool new mods as well as some relevant updates.

- The assorted radio mods were replaced with the combined [Diamond City Radio Extended](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/56898).

- [Facials for Everyone](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37180) expands the face preset lists without affecting performance.

#### Website Changes

With this update, I gave the website a much-needed once over. Most improvements are relatively minor and were not documented.

- **Introduction:** Slightly restructured the page and updated the feature list.
- **Installation:** Consolidated all sub-pages to a single long one. Attempted to shorten it a little and fixed a few broken links.
- **Installation:** Added instructions on how to enable Easy Lockpicking and Hacking.
- **Mod Config:** Removed step about applying FallUI HUD preset. Turns out the MCM preset already does it!
- **WTP Visuals:** Slightly updated the documentation. The screenshots are a tad outdated and will be replaced asap.
- **WTP Gameplay:** Slightly updated the documentation.

## Release 2.2

> 13/01/2022

With this update I am removing This Is Trash, WTP's scrapping mod which should some performance issues and flickering. Neither This Is Trash nor Previs Repair Pack are causing this issue, but using both at the same time would require me to regenerate previs/precombines for places where they overlap if I wanted to avoid issues. To tell you the truth, the whole process is time-consuming and annoying, and I do not care enough about Fallout 4 modding to dive any deeper into this. Hence, the removal of This Is Trash.

In other news, I re-added Ultrawide (21:9) support. Folks with 2560x1080 or 3440x1440 monitor resolutions will now be able to play with a properly adjusted UI.

**This update is NOT save-safe.**

Remember to copy over Game Folder Files again to update the ENB preset.

## Release 2.1

> 25/12/2021

## Release 2.0

> 01/12/2021

**A new save is required.**

Welcome to Paradise 2.0 goes back to the roots. The list was refocused to vanilla improvements with a great deal of sorely needed back-end changes, including a full rebuild with detailed documentation of all edits in Mod Organizer 2. Lingering issues and annoyances from previous versions (that I know of) were eliminated with the result being an overall more consistent, polished experience.

- New lighting and ENB combination for more consistent visuals as well as brighter nights and interiors.
- Better shadow INI settings to reduce pop-in and blurry shadows (thanks SpringHeelJon!).
- Replaced Boston FPS Fix with Previs Pack to eliminate some crashes and improve performance in even more areas.
- Replaced Workshop Re-arranged with smaller, more managable workshop additions.
- New retextures, most of which were added to the WTP texture packs for better performance.
- MCM settings can now be applied automatically via a universal WTP preset thanks to MCM Settings Manager.
- Finally some documentation in the form of the new [WTP Visuals](/fo4/wtp/documentation/wtp-visuals/) and [WTP Gameplay](/fo4/wtp/documentation/wtp-gameplay/) pages.

**ENB and lighting changes:**

In WTP 2.0, I removed [True Storms](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4472), [True Nights](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9253), and [Subtle ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5885). The decision was not easy as I have never really played Fallout 4 *without* True Storms, and I really love the murky nights with this combination of mods. Unfortunately, True Storms makes the game's lackluster occlusion effect (intended to prevent rain and fogs in interiors) even more noticable. I also had a ton of people complain about dark nights.

With this update, WTP is switching to [Clarity](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31991) for some fantastic all around improvements to visuals as well as the lightweight [FallOpt ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/55662) preset. This combination also mostly replaced [Interiors Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8768) which means that interiors are a little brighter now.

**Removal of CBBE and EVB:**

I ended up removing the body replacers in this update. There is simply nothing I really need CBBE for and EVB male bodies do not have dismemberment support.

**Removal of Workshop Re-arranged:**

Workshop Re-arranged is a pretty great workshop overhaul. Unfortunately, it's also extremely difficult to work with on account of its rebalancing edits which change many of the building requirements as well as junk scrap yields. I finally decided to ditch the mod and return to smaller, individual workshop additions.

**BOS Power Armor Paint Jobs:**

I realised that without the stat changes, there is no need to have separate Knight/Paladin/Sentinel paint jobs for the power armor as they are visually identical. The exception is the Left Arm piece which displays the rank insignia. I rectified this by adding a single "Brotherhood of Steel" paint job that can be applied to any piece of power armor, then limiting the rank-specific paint job to Left Arm pieces. Problem solved!

## Release 1.6.3

> 14/08/2021

This update finally brings back WTP after an extended downtime due to Nexit. I was extremely unhappy to remove the Stormy Nights main menu replacer and Full Dialogue Interface (for which the string patch was taken down), but there is nothing to be done. I apologise that it took me so long to bring WTP back, it remains more of a smaller side project for me and sadly I have not felt the Fallout 4 itch in quite some time. Nevertheless, the list has always been doing surprisingly well, much better than I had expected, so I will definitely continue to maintain it.

This is update is **not save-safe**. Please copy over the Game Folder Files into your root folder once again as the ENB binaries were updated.

#### Mod Changes

- Disabled frame limit in enblocal.ini (oversight from when I reinstalled ENBSeries in 1.6.2)
- Enabled VSYNC in High FPS Physics Fix (should always be on)
- Removed the main menu replacer as it was deleted from the Nexus (damn shame, it's been my favourite for years)
- Removed More Attackers - Get Off My Buildzone as a master from the CRP
- Removed More Attackers - Get Off My Buildzone (removed from the Nexus)
- Removed Full Dialogue Interface
- Removed String Patches for Full Dialogue Interface (removed from the Nexus)
- Removed F4 Creation Kit Fixes from Game Folder Files
- Updated ENBSeries binaries to 0.461
- Updated Workshop Framework to 2.0.16
- Updated Synthkind Redefined HD to 1.01
- Updated What's Your Name to 1.12.1
- Updated Vault 88 Essentials to 1.1
- Added Extended Dialogue Interface

## Release 1.6.2

> 27/06/2021

This is just a quick update to fix two minor issues and update a couple of mods. Since Wabbajack updated to 2.5.0.0, I had to recompile anyway.

Update your **Game Folder Files** to get the new ENBSeries binaries. The update is **save safe**.

#### Mod Changes

- Updated ENBSeries to 0.458
- Updated the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch to 2.1.3
- Updated Buffout to 1.23.1
- Updated Workshop Framework to 2.0.15a
- Updated FallUI - Inventory to 1.13.3
- Updated FallUI - HUD to 1.4
- Updated Console Commands Extender to 1.2.0
- Maybe fixed UI elements sometimes being misaligned
- Fixed a few minor issues in Home Plate (thanks C19i)

## Release 1.6.1

> 04/06/2021

As it turns out, I got sloppy last night. I'd already recompiled once when [Bullet Counted Reload System](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41178) updated and part of the update was support for [Tactical Reload](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/49444). I dropped in both, did a cursory check in xEdit, fixed some conflicts, and called it a day. Evidently I shouldn't have done that as something about the combination has caused frequent crashes in WTP 1.6 that was reported twice so far and I was able to reproduce it on my end. Dropping Tactical Reload fixed it so at least there was an easy solution. I haven't investigated further why exactly the crashes happen because I frankly don't care about the mod that much and don't have time today either.

This update is **save safe**. It's a crash fix. You'll be asked about missing plugins when loading your save, click Yes.

#### Mod Changes

- Removed Tactical Reload
- Replaced the TR version of BCR Lever Action Rifle with the regular one
- Removed Tactical Reload as a master from the CRP

## Release 1.6

> 03/06/2021

**Starting a new game is required.**

For this update I checked out the new **FallUI** suite of interface replacers and took the opportunity to review WTP's existing interface mods. I came to the decision to once again remove [Extended Dialogue Interface](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27216) and revert to [Full Dialogue Interface](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/1235) which I like far better. After careful consideration, I decided *against* including [FallUI - HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/51813) because even with my DEF_UI HUD preset, it would make item pickup prompts look [weird](https://i.imgur.com/Bd9w9VZ.jpg) with a huge gap between the item name and the button prompts. I also removed FallUI - Map because I didn't like it. However, FallUI - HUD and FallUI - Map are still going to be installed in case someone wants them (but are disabled by default).

I also removed **Widescreen** support. I can't test it, it's additional headache, I'd have to write extra instructions for changing the aspect ratio in the various FallUI MCMs. Sorry to everyone on ultrawide monitors, it's just not worth the effort to me.

When updating, please also move the Game Folder Files into your root folder and overwrite (ENB binaries updated).

**K-9 Harness**

Until now fadingsignal's K-9 Harness for Dogmeat could be crafted at the crafting station which was the original implementation. I have never been happy with this and in this update I finally did something about it. You can now find exactly *one* K-9 Harness in the world. The location happens to be a police station for obvious reasons - if you want to know where exactly you can find it, double-click the new K-9 Integration Patch in Mod Organizer 2 and check the **Notes** tab.

**Creation Club**

WTP 1.6 adds *optional* support for some "creations" (only the Modular Military Backpack so far). You can find details and instructions [here](/fallout-4/wtp/wtp-resources/creation-club).

## Release 1.5.2

*Turns out that Wabbajack auto-sets the resolution in the INI files.*

## Release 1.5.1

> 08/03/2021

I fixed some errors in `Power Armor Lore-Friendly Distribution.esp` by reverting the levelled lists for Atom Cats power armor to vanilla. That means they'll be wearing T-60 armor again (instead of T-51). I know I had Atom Cats T-51 armor *somewhere* but it seems to have gotten lost, resulting in these errors. I fully admit that this is a lazy solution but it works and that was always enough for Todd anyway.

While recompiling for WJ, I also updated the links to the website (see below).

## Global Site Update

> 08/03/2021

I finally did some spring cleaning. For the longest time it annoyed me that in my original folder structure I had categorised pages by games, for example the TPF part of the website was called "Skyrim SE" in the top menu. But what if I want to start another SE project? And you don't want to know the chaos in my pictures folder either.

The reason I hesitated for so long to change the folder names is because it breaks every, single, link. And while fixing the internal links and file paths was merely a minor annoyance, fixing all external links is more difficult - especially considering that other people may link to TPF as well and those links are now broken. Of course I also need to recompile both TPF and WTP for Wabbajack to update the links that open automatically upon installing a Wabbajack list.

Well, I finally updated now and I'm very happy with the changes. It likely will take some time for all external links to get fix plus I suspect I may have missing some internal links and file paths.

#### Changes

- Removed the Bioware section (see below).
- Renamed "Skyrim SE" to "The Phoenix Flavour" (link changed from skyrim-se to tpf).
- Renamed "Fallout 4" to "Welcome to Paradise" (link changed from fallout to wtp).
- Updated all internal links and file paths - hopefully.
- Cleaned up my pictures folder to remove any pictures that are no longer in the guide.
- Updated the home page, it has two buttons now and a combination of the TPF and WTP pics.

#### Bioware

The current state of things is that I have published a guide for ME1 with a draft for an ME2 version waiting for revision. But here's the thing: Modding Bioware games is quite different from modding Bethesda games. I've only really dipped my toes in it and wouldn't call myself an expert by any stretch of the imagination. Something I often criticise about various smaller Skyrim modding "guides" is that their authors barely know what they're doing. It occured to me that my Mass Effect "guides" are in essence the same thing ~~with better formatting~~.

To keep a longer story short, I have developed a strong sense of imposter syndrome over those excursions into Bioware land that is causing me a fair amount of stress. Something I've learned over the past couple years is that if you have too many things putting pressure on you at once, cut out everything that's non-essential. Well, this time the scissors are for the Bioware section of the TPF website.

## Release 1.5

#### Simple Sorting Overhaul

As we have now switched to FallUI from DEF_INV, I updated my INNRs (naming rules) to have the same format as Ruddy's sorting patcher that FallUI was intended for. That means mods for armors and weapons will be displayed in smaller font below the item name.

I did take a look at the [Complex Sorter](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48826) for FallUI which would be very convenient for me but ultimately I prefer my own icons and INNRs. Plus they already cover my power armor changes and include my preferred power armor naming scheme.

#### Website Changes

I went over all pages and fixed what I thought needed fixing. Screenshots were updated, sentences were rephrased, and instructions were clarified.

- **Finalisation:** Added instructions for the optional LUTs.
- **Finalisation:** Added Controller Fix instructions (required because of an issue with FallUI).
