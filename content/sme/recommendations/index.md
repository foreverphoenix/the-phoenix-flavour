## Assorted Fixes & Tweaks

Following initial feedback, I decided to completely cut all included fixes that might not be completely compatible with any setup, or are down to personal taste. Instead I decided to add this list of my recommendations for various fixes and tweaks with some notes. Please note that me recommending these mods doesn't mean you should install them all and assume everything works. You still need to decide for yourself what you need/want, and whether what you are adding is compatible/necessary with your setup.

- [Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975) to complement the USSEP.
- [Unofficial Skyrim Modder's Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49616) to complement the USSEP. Check this one carefully before deciding to add it. Some of the tweaks/fixes listed below are already included with it.
- [Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994): Highly subjective and very bloated collection of various changes, but contains some extremely neat fixes and tweaks. I recommend taking it apart and using only the parts you want/need.
- [LOD Unloading Bug Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61251), though this should NOT be necessary with DynDOLOD 3.
- [Weapon Speed Effects Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27677) will require some patching or may be redundant depending your perk/shout overhauls.
- [Enchantable Special Item Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65154) will need patching for your load order.

### Landscape Fixes

- [Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138)
- [Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005), as the name suggests this mod is only required if you use a grass mod (that applies grass to more textures than vanilla).
- [Complementary Grass Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71562), an addon for LFFGM.
- [Grass Fixes for Creation Club Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61777), same as the above but for CCs.

### Gameplay Tweaks

- [Fast Travel Speed Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1503) more closely aligns the time passed after fast travelling to what it would have been after walking on foot. Of course, you could argue taking a horse or a carriage, or taking a different route are all factors that might impact this, so it is somewhat subjective. The tweak is included in [Obsidian Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125).
- [Better Jumping](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18967)
- [Enhanced Reanimation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43500)
- [Whose Quest Is It Anyway](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23581)
- [Mum's the Word](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27713)
- [Rude Imperial Escort Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/894)
- [Dawnguard Don't Hunt Cured Vampires](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5471)
- [NARC Remade](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17946) so animals stop reporting you for crimes.
- [Calm Down Valdr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33058)
- [Greybeard Robe Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53515)
- [Potema's Minion Fixlet](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51000)
- [Don't Talk With Your Mouth Full](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17715)
- [Butterflies Land True](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29434)

### Display Cases

- [Hearthfire Display Case Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3622): Makes display boxes much more convenient by adding activators to them. No longer will you have to manual place items. Be warned that the plugin needs to be resaved in the CK. [Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994) already includes this.
- Alternatively, I would recommend [Immersive Display Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70508) which is even more convenient since you no longer need have an item equipped to place it in/on any kind of display. However, it does require all display activators to be set up correctly following the USSEP's example, otherwise it'll throw errors. Display activators can be fixed fairly quickly in xEdit.

### Animations

- [D13 Faster Get Up Stand Up](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5890) significantly increases the speed at which any actor gets back to their feet after being knocked down. Recommended to be paired with (or replaced by) [Super Fast Get Up Animation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46714).
- [3rd person Dual Wield Animation Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2425) makes the third person dual wield stance look less ridiculous. Incompatible/redundant with other animation replacers.

### Texture Fixes

- [Eye Normal Map Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5445) improves the vanilla normal maps, but may not be compatible with any replacer mod.
- [Blood (Green) Dragon Texture Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51097)
- [HD Serpentine Dragon and Mesh Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18370)

### Mesh Fixes

- [Flickering Meshes Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53957)
- [Fixed Mesh Lighting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53653)

- [Glowing Mushroom Collision Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69558)
- [Hawk Patch - Base Object Swapper Remake](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71546)
- [Werewolf Claws Affect Spider Webs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11431)
- [Cumulative Fix for Eye Meshes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71524), the underwater fix removes blending on the lashes which can look really weird so you may want to use the version without that fix.
