## Release 1.1

> 21/07/2022

Following feedback, I decided to do some pruning where more controversial "fixes" were concerned and add a few more tools. Some of these I have not been using extensively before and while I tested them all, I cannot exclude the possibility that I missed something in the setup. If that is the case I will fix it asap.

Including a section of fix mods is very difficult as many are somewhat subjective or not compatible with / required for every setup. For one mod in particular, I have had people both very happy about its inclusion and completely opposed to it. So I decided to yeet most mods that could possibly be controversial and wrote up [a list of recommendations](/sme/recommendations) instead. Refer to that, please.

Thanks to Tyler/Night_Thastus and Parapets in particular for your feedback and recommendations!
