  About Skyrim Modding Essentials.
---

**Skyrim Modding Essentials** is a Wabbajack utility list for Skyrim Special Edition, intended to jumpstart a new mod setup with all the required tools and basic mods. As such, it is intended for *experienced* modders and no support will be provided beyond the contents of the list itself. 

The list was made for Skyrim SE 1.6.x. However, the Anniversary Edition DLC is not required.

## Features

Check the complete mod list and load order on [Load Order Library](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/skyrim-modding-essentials-sme).

- Clean MO2 setup with documentation for all changes in the Notes and further documentation on the [website](/sme/documentation/).
- The foundational collections of tweaks and fixes: [SSE Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230), [po3's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073), [Scrambled Bugs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532).
- Additional fixes that should be relevant for and compatible with any setup. To be expanded.
- Optionally includes full widescreen support with all relevant patches.
- Optionally includes ENB binaries, premade enblocal.ini, and supplementary mods.

SME uses the Stock Game folder system. That means the setup includes a unique copy of your vanilla game, ensuring the setup is completely standalone and whatever you keep in your default installation folder will not affect the setup at all. This is a lifesaver when you keep more than one instance of MO2. Setting up all tools for Stock Game folder can be a little annoying so you're welcome, it's all done for you.

## Installation

Please refer to the [Installation](/sme/installation/) page.

## FAQ

**What about VSYNC?**

VSYNC is forced through SSE Display Tweaks by default which is preferable to Skyrim's native VSYNC, or ENB VSYNC. In other words, there is nothing you need to change.

**How do I enable widescreen support?**

Check all the mods from the Widescreen Support section. The monitor resolution should be set correctly by default.

**Are any texture replacers included?**

No, because I wanted to keep the list as lean as possible and because there is no point. For those who wish to have improved vanilla textures, just grab [Project Clarity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45306). Everyone else has their preferred texture packs, or they're completely nuts and hand-pick everything (don't like at me like that, I know I'm not the only one who does it). Similarly, there are no LODs. Do 'em yourself, that's what the list is for.

**Can I suggest a mod for inclusion?**

Yes, you can! Please do so on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xCPxJFbCTS) and be aware that the likelihood that I will say "no" is quite high. Because this list has to provide a good base for *any* setup, the criteria for new additions are quite strict.

#### Why isn't X mod included?

[FileAccess Interface for Skyrim SE Scripts (FISSES)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13956): Not included because it tends to become unstable when it is used to load presets for multiple MCMs. Mod authors should use [MCM Helper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53000) to make saving MCM configurations easy and convenient.

The mesh fixes section is very incomplete, but I refrained from adding several mods because of how sensitive to conflicts they are. Figuring out your setup's meshes is somewhat time-consuming and depends on whether you use split meshes to minimise flickering (grab [Flickering Meshes Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53957)) and whether you use parallax. Additionally, many mesh fix mods have a lot of overlap with other mods which at times include them, modified or as-is. Finally, mods like [Fixed Mesh Lighting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53653) (highly recommended) include many patches which, again, depend on your own setup. Completing this section is therefore up to you.
