# LEGENDS OF THE FROST

*Legends of the Frost is Skyrim, but better. Textures are sharper, trees are lusher, weathers are more diverse, and water no longer looks like oil. A collection of less than 200 mods fixes a plethora of bugs and annoyances in addition to bringing some light improvements to combat and balancing. LOTF also features seamless blending of distant terrain and trees as well as high quality facegen.*
